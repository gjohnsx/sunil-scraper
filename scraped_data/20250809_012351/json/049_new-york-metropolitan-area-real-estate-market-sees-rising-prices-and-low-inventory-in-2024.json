  "description": "The 2024 real estate market across the New York metropolitan area, as represented by the full market reach of OneKey® MLS subscribers, experienced rising home prices, continued inventory constraints, and a slight decline in closed sales. The closed median sale price for the region reached $637,500, reflecting a 9.5% increase over 2023. Individual property types saw varying degrees of appreciation, with single-family homes up 9.4%, condominiums rising 6.3%, and co-ops increasing slightly by 0.7%. Despite higher home prices, 48,857 closed sales transactions were recorded in 2024, representing a 2.5% decrease compared to the previous year. The highest number of closed sales occurred in Suffolk County with 12,913, followed by Nassau County with 9,748, and Westchester County with 7,127. One of the most significant market challenges remained low inventory. The number of available homes for sale fell by 6.8% to 13,091, continuing a trend that has constrained buyer options. However, pending sales increased by 1.5% to 51,060, indicating a steady level of buyer demand heading into 2025.",
