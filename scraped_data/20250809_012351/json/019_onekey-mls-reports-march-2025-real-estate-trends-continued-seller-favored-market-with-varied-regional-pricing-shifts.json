  "description": "OneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers. In March, the closed median sale price for single-family homes in the region reached $718,500, an increase of 10.5% from $650,000 in March 2024. Condominium prices also saw a modest rise, with a closed median sale price of $515,000, up 3.6% year-over-year. In contrast, the co-op market experienced a decline, with a closed median sale price of $285,000, down 5% from $300,000 in the same period last year.",
