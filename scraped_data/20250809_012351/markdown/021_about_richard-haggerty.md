# Staff

Every day, the staff of OneKey® MLS identifies new opportunities to help real estate professionals succeed.

## Richard Haggerty

## Chief Executive Officer

Richard Haggerty is a New Yorker. Richard's career has taken him through many geographical stomping grounds, but it is the character of New York that he embodies. That New York resilience and resourcefulness has led him to serve in leadership positions over four decades at both local, state, and national REALTOR® association levels and at two multiple listing systems (MLSs). He has served on numerous committees, including the Professional Standards Committee and the Association Executive Committee of the National Association of REALTORS®. He has been named as one of the Swanepoel Top 200 as one of the most powerful and influential executives in the residential real estate brokerage industry.

﻿

Richard has offered his guidance and stewardship on behalf of the goal of homeownership throughout his career leading him to be inducted into the Dr. Almon R. (Bud) Smith, RCE, AE Leadership Society of the National Association of REALTORS®, Inc in 2015. His empire state of mind confidently carried him through the inception of OneKey® and has helped develop OneKey® MLS into a solution that is uniquely positioned to help its customers thrive in a highly competitive and fast-paced market with constant forward momentum, a fluid strategy that finds opportunity in each iteration. It finds strength in diversity, possibility in change, and anticipates the unique needs that this culturally rich melting pot of a marketplace requires: from the “black dirt” farms of Orange County to the high rises or Manhattan, to the waterfront villages of Long Island. With Richard at the helm OneKey® MLS, they’re raising the bar for those they serve--real estate professionals and consumers alike-- reaching out for new, next, and best, knowing the status quo is not an option.

Described by his contemporaries as a “thoughtful visionary,” Richard’s comportment is distinguished by a personal dignity and respect for fellow individuals from all walks of life. He listens more than he speaks, but when he speaks, the content is considered, to-the-point, and his audience leans in so as not to miss what he has to say. A passionate and powerful speaker, who mixes gravitas with humor skillfully, Richard’s experience as a national and state instructor is displayed in his engaging presentation style and you’ll find him leading at local and industry events. His members trust and respect him and you’ll find him equally considered in his attention to a member’s concern as to a fellow executive’s greeting. Richard brings to bear the well-earned trust of his community — a feat not achieved overnight and built on a foundation of performance, integrity, and engaged listening. Richard knows how to facilitate and bring divergent concerns into alignment and exhibit willingness to put himself on the line and put himself out there in pursuit of the best outcomes for his 45,000+ customers and consumers in the Metropolitan New York Area that OneKey® MLS serves as exhibited in the 2023 acquisition of Mid-Hudson MLS.
