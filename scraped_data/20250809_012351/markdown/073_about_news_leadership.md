### [Fair Housing - No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)

By Melissa King•April 18, 2025

As an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.

### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)

By Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025

Five years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.

### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)

By Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025

April is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all. Assuring that everyone has the same access to information about listings and opportunities to view properties is essential. Take action and support Fair Housing Forward by:
