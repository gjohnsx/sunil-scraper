# Client Collaboration

### Take care of your clients and see them through the entire transaction with robust collaboration tools from OneKey® MLS

[Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660057654292-Client-Collaboration)

### Clients want immediate and informed help 24x7x365 when they're looking for a home. Good thing OneKey® MLS can help you take care of business.

#### Meaningful collaboration starts with Matrix™

OneKey® MLS's collaboration platform begins with Matrix™  where you can enable your clients to view property listings, save favorites, and set up alerts in a personalized portal branded with your logo and headshot. You can also auto-email property alerts based on specific criteria, such as location, price range, or property features. When a new listing that matches comes on the market, your client automatically gets an email. Clients can also set up a property search, so that you and your client can explore various options together, and work as a team to find the right property. Best of all, you can track what your clients like and don't like from within Matrix™, so you can respond with more targeted listings and proactively follow-up with alternatives that better fit their needs. And of course, Matrix™ is completely mobile, so you can work from anywhere, and add notes to listings your clients can see, or review their search history and preferences.

#### Finding a fit in OneHome™

Collaboration opportunities continue in OneHome™, the sleek consumer portal that is natively integrated with Matrix™. OneHome™ is available to all OneKey® MLS agents and brokers, though clients can participate by invitation only. Clients enjoy OneHome's personalized property recommendations made through the PropertyFit™ algorithm, which is based on their preferences, browsing history, and saved searches. The more a client interacts with PropertyFit™, the more tailored their recommendations become. It makes the search process more dynamic and personalized, so you can focus on more relevant properties. OneHome™ also provides detailed insights into your clients' activity, including which listings they view, save, or ignore so you can understand their preferences more clearly. An interactive tour planner enables clients to select homes they would like to see; you see the list, make comments, finalize appointments and send the schedule. It's highly efficient collaboration for everyone.

#### Mobile collaboration in real-time with MLS-Touch®

Nothing beats real-time communication, and MLS-Touch® enables you to communicate directly within the app so you can send messages, share listings, and ask (and answer!) questions. You can also see which listings your clients view, save, or discard right within the app, so you can refine what you present to your clients no matter where you are. Because MLS-Touch® is an iOS and Android app, it can also send automatic push notifications to clients about price changes, status changes, or other alerts you deem important so you stay top of mind. And because the app is co-branded with your brand and contact information, it reinforces your brand and professionalism.

#### Simplify the transaction

Once your clients have found their new home, the transaction begins ... and for many clients, that's the part that requires evenmoreof your time. Help your rental clients though the application process with RentSpree's streamlined and automated process, which only requires them to fill out one application that can be reused for many properties. RentSpree handles all aspects of the application process, including background and credit checks via Transunion. On OneKey® MLS, rentals eligible for RentSpree are noted in Matrix™. Help your home buyer clients understand what they can really afford early in their home search via RatePlug. Just connect RatePlug in Matrix to your listings and lenders, and start sharing the more detailed costs of homeownership. Transaction management is a snap when it comes time to managing the offer and closing in TransactionDesk, because all of the necessary forms are populated with the appropriate OneKey® MLS data, and a secure portal enables you to share documents 24x7x365 with your clients.
