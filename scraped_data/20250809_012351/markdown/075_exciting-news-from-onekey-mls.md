# Exciting News from OneKey MLS!

Tricia Chirco • December 20, 2023

### All OneKey® MLS Participants to Transition to New Platform in Q4, 2024

![Core Logic® Matrix™ Dashboard](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Matrix-Dashboard-New-1920w.png)

The OneKey® MLS Board of Managers is excited to announce that in the fourth quarter of 2024, all OneKey MLS Participants and Subscribers will be transitioning to CoreLogic®’s MLS Platform, Matrix™.

After extensive review and analysis of numerous MLS systems, the Board of Managers has selected Matrix. The Matrix platform is modern and robust, where users can create professional listing presentations, gain powerful insights to help evaluate client activity and maximize business efforts, and connect with customers across multiple channels. It’s the next generation MLS.

Matrix is accessible through the Clareity dashboard, which provides easy navigation to the full range of OneKey MLS tools via single sign-on technology. Matrix works seamlessly with many of the existing OneKey MLS products, including MLS-Touch, an innovative mobile solution that provides easy access to MLS data on-the-go. The integration automatically syncs saved contacts, saved searches, and Realist® data. Moreover, customer relationships are improved with the addition of OneHome, a fully integrated client collaboration portal that provides you with a detailed view of all client activities, so clients never fall through the cracks. CoreLogic has designed all of these products for interoperability, ensuring the exchange of information to increase efficiency and accuracy.

The new listing management experience will not only be more intuitive and streamlined, but will also provide a new feature that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze, identify, and tag features in listing photos. These image tags will propose a label and description for each photo uploaded to a listing.

OneKey MLS’s Board of Managers Chairperson Frank DellAccio remarked that Long Island agents have needed an MLS system upgrade for several years. “Change is unavoidable, but with change comes opportunity. As our business needs change, our MLS system must technologically evolve to keep pace and better serve our subscribers so they can meet their customers’ expectations. As the #1 MLS platform in North America, the Matrix platform gets us there.”

OneKey MLS leadership is committed to making this process as transparent as possible. The first phase of the transition focuses on data accuracy, including data fields, lookup, and type to ensure consistency and precision. Then, in the following months, virtual and in-person trainings will be conducted on how to use Matrix so subscribers will be sufficiently prepared. As always, we are here to support you in any way we can and we will keep you apprised at every step throughout the process, so you are fully informed.

### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)

By Richard Washington•June 30, 2025

National Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra "The time to make a difference is now," Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

### [Fair Housing - No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)

By Melissa King•April 18, 2025

As an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.

OneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.

### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)

By Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025

Ocusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.

### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)

By Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025

Five years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.
