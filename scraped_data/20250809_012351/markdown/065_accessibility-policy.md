# ADA Compliance Statement

## Accessibility Policy

OneKey® MLS is committed to providing an accessible website. If you have difficulty accessing content, have difficulty viewing a file on the website, or notice any accessibility problems, please contact OneKey® MLS at [support@onekeymls.com](mailto:support@onekeymls.com) to specify the nature of the accessibility issue and any assistive technology you use. OneKey® MLS will strive to provide the content you need in the format you require.

#### Our Commitment to Accessibility

We are continually working to improve the accessibility of our Site to ensure it is usable by individuals with disabilities. Our goal is to comply with applicable accessibility laws and guidelines, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which provide recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities.

#### Third-Party Content

While we strive to ensure the accessibility of our Site, some content may be provided by third parties. We cannot guarantee the accessibility of third-party websites or services linked to or embedded in our Site. However, we encourage third-party providers to comply with accessibility standards and recommend users reach out to them directly with any concerns.

#### Ongoing Accessibility Enhancements

We are committed to continuous improvement of our Site's accessibility. Our goal is to keep our Site up to date with evolving accessibility standards and to provide an inclusive digital experience for all users, regardless of ability.

#### Web Accessibility Help

##### I am visually impaired.

If you have trouble seeing web pages, the [US Social Security Administration offers these tips](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/index.html) for optimizing your computer and browser to improve your online experience.

- Use your computer to read web pages out loud
- Use the keyboard to navigate screens
- Increase text size
- Magnify your screen
- Change background and text colors
- Make your mouse pointer more visible

##### I find a keyboard or mouse hard to use.

If you find a keyboard or mouse difficult to use, speech recognition software is available that may help you navigate web pages and online services. This software allows you to move focus around a web page or application screen through voice controls.

##### I am deaf or hard of hearing.

If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there are several accessibility features available to you.

#### Transcripts

A text transcript is a text equivalent of audio information that includes spoken words and non-spoken sounds such as sound effects. OneKey® MLS is reviewing adding transcripts to scripted video and audio content.

#### Captioning

A caption is a transcript for the audio track of a video presentation that is synchronized with the video and audio tracks. Captions are generally rendered visually by being superimposed over the video, which benefits people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, and anyone who cannot hear the audio (e.g., when in a crowded room). The videos linked on our OneKey® MLS websites to YouTube and Vimeo have captions readily available. [Learn how to turn captioning on and off in YouTube.](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/100078?hl=en)

#### Volume Controls

Your computer, tablet, or mobile device has volume control features. Each video and audio service has its own additional volume controls. Try adjusting both your device’s volume controls and your media players’ volume controls to optimize your listening experience.
