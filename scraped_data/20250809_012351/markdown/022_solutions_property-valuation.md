# Property Valuation

### Pricing a listing is as much a science as an art. OneKey® MLS has all the tools you need to support both sides of the equation

### When the seller looks you in the eye and asks you "WHY?" we've got your back with tools, data, and analysis to explain.

#### There are comps ... and then there arecomps

Everyone knows selecting comparable properties to the subject propertyseemseasy, until it's not. You need to look for recent sales, as well as homes that are similar in square footage, size, age, and condition. You need at least five or more, preferably, active and expired, to average out the pricing. What if it's a hot market? Ornot? What if there's just no comparable inventory? All of a sudden, those comps are not easy at all. That's where OneKey® MLS's suite of CMA tools makes your job a whole lot better. Use Matrix™ to pull active and pending listings, as well as historical sales data. Then complement those comps with an analysis from Realist®. That's where you can find in-depth public records, long-term property and tax data, and pricing trends that can help you accurately value your subject property and complement the active, pending, and recently sold properties in the MLS aren't quite right. Check out Remine Pro if you want to overlay other potential sellers (unearthed by predictive analytics) into your CMA, which can influence the valuation you ultimately agree on with your seller.

#### Finally, a helpful automated valuation

Automated valuation models are phenomenal conversation-starters, but they're often wrong and cause everyone headaches. When it comes to valuing your seller's property, Realtors Property Resource® (RPR®)'s Realtor Valuation Model® is a proprietary algorithm exclusive to REALTORS® based on MLS data and public records that is specifically designed to counteract AVMs that wildly over- or underestimate a property's value. The RVM® differs from a traditional AVM because it integrates real-time MLS data (including active, pending, and sold listings), it can produce more accurate property valuations compared to standard AVMs that rely solely on public records. MLS data allows the RVM® to consider more detailed property characteristics (e.g., condition, upgrades) that might not be reflected in public records. This makes the RVM® a more precise tool for estimating current market value. Most important, you, as the agent, can adjust the RVM® using your expertise and local knowledge, so you can refine the valuation further before presenting it to your seller. The RVM® works for you builds the seller's confidence by demonstrating your pricing expertise, giving you a competitive edge.

#### Beautiful branded presentations

When it comes time to present your findings to your seller and win your listing presentation, you have plenty of options. You can create a handsome CMA in either Realist® or Remine Pro, or use a premium theme from Cloud CMA with pre-written content you can customize. Simply pull in your listings, select your data points, and drop in your logo, headshot and brand colors, and prepare to wow your seller with the depth of your expertise and insights.
