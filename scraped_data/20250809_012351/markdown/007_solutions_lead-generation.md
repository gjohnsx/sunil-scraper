# Lead Generation

### No matter what kind of prospects you're looking for, they're all here in OneKey® MLS's data

[Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660072338452-Lead-Generation)

### Building a farm? Looking for owners likely to sell? Identifying short sales for investors? If you want to grow your business with data, OneKey® MLS has the tools to help you win.

#### Farming has never been easier

When you put Remine Pro to work to build your farm, start by identifying the neighborhood, subdivision, or zip code you want to focus on. Remine can offer signals about homeowners including whether they have lots of equity (mortgage maturity), have lived in their home more than seven years (ownership tenure), or don't live there at all (absentee, landlords or out-of-state owners), all of which can indicate that they may be ready to sell. Utilize Remine's predictive analytics to identify the homeowners on your list that are statistically more likely to sell in the next 4-6 months. Now, save your list of potential sellers. This targeted marketing list can be exported to Excel or CSV format, and you can use it to create a highly effective and efficient multi-channel marketing campaign. Best of all, your list will update when changes occur.

#### Generate leads for your listings

There are 43,000 agents who participate in OneKey® MLS, and more than a million listings in our system. When you enter your new listing into Matrix™, you canreverse prospectfor buyers agents who have clients looking for listings just like yours. How? When clients' of buyer's agents save searches in Matrix™, the data is cross-referenced against any listing that is also made available for reverse prospecting. Then you, as the listing agent, can look for a list of buyer's agents whose clients have saved searches that match your property. This list shows the buyer’s agent's contact information but keeps the client’s identity confidential. This way, instead of waiting for buyer's agents to find your listing, you can proactively contact them and generate leads for your listing in the OneKey® MLS network. Instead of casting a wide net, you can target the most engaged buyers who are already in contract with an agent.

#### Get leads from New Yorkers and beyond

Millions of consumers visit OneKeyMLS.com every month to shop for new homes. Whether they're for sale or rent, or commercial properties, consumers spend an average of up to 10 minutes a session on their mobile devices on the site, and they look at 6-8 listings during their visit. About 85 percent of the traffic for OneKeyMLS.com is from the New York Metropolitan area. That translates into thousands of local leads for OneKey® MLS agents and brokers, all of which are sent directly to the listing agent and their broker. So when you see an email from OneKeyMLS.com in your inbox, open it. It's an inquiry from a consumer about your listing, courtesy of OneKey® MLS.

#### Create data-driven leads

The comprehensive public records and real estate data in Realist® can create a steady pipeline of potential leads, whether you specialize in residential sales or probate, foreclosure or bank-owned/REO properties. Realist®'s enormous variety of filters, from properties with recently paid-off mortgages, recent value increases, or homeowners with high equity, represent just a fraction of the opportunities to be found. Realist®'s deep data can also reveal many other events that may negatively affect the property but present an opportunity to help a homeowner in distress, such as probate, delinquent taxes, and pre-foreclosure. No matter what type of business you want to develop, Realist® can help you focus on it and optimize your lead generation efforts. Once you've defined your farm, save it, export it to an Excel or CSV, and start marketing to it.
