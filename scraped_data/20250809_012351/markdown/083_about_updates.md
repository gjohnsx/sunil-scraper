# Multiple Listing Options for Sellers

# and Clear Cooperation Policy

On March 25, 2025 The National Association of REALTORS® (NAR)  unveiled a new policy called " **Multiple Listing Options for Sellers**".  This policy**does not**waive mandatory submission deadlines or replace Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP), but works alongside it. The new policy is designed to give consumers clearer freedom in marketing their homes while ensuring fairness to buyers.

This new policy offers more choices for sellers and their agents in marketing a property. Multiple Listing Options for Sellers includes two exempt listing options:

- **Office Exclusives (designated with the Private Y/N field in OneKey MLS)**

This is an exempt listing where the seller has directed that their property not be disseminated through the MLS and not be publicly marketed. The office exclusive listing is entered in OneKey MLS but is visible only to the listing brokerage. It does not disseminate to other sites, or other OneKey MLS Participants or Subscribers.

- **NEW** **Delayed Marketing**

This is an exempt listing where the seller directs the listing broker to delay the public marketing of that listing through IDX and syndication for a period (\*time period to be determined by OneKey MLS Board of Managers) while making the listing visible to other real estate professionals within OneKey MLS. During the delayed marketing period the home seller and the listing agent can market the listing in a manner consistent with the seller's needs and interests.

Broker-to-broker, one-to-one communication may occur freely about office exclusive listings or delayed marketing exempt listings without triggering Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP) requirements to make the listing public and Active within one (1) business day. Both exempt listing options require informed consent from the seller certified in writing including:

- disclosure about the professional relationship between Participant and seller
- acknowledgement that the seller understands the MLS benefits they are waiving or delaying
- confirmation of the seller's decision

Please note that this new policy will be implemented by September 30, 2025, or sooner.
