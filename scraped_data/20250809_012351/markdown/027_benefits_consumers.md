# Consumer Benefits

##### OneKey® MLS is the best source for accurate information about homes for sale and rent in the New York metropolitan area. If it’s been bought or sold in our service area, one of our real estate professionals likely handled the transaction, and we have a record of it

## 1M+ million Listings in Long Island, Manhattan, and the Hudson Valley.

#### Wide geographic coverage

OneKey® MLS serves 43,000 REALTORS® who work in Long Island, Manhattan, and the Lower Hudson Valley. We are the largest MLS in New York state, and the 10th largest MLS in the United States. Our scale gives us the ability to provide our real estate professionals with technology that helps their clients find the right home more quickly.

#### OneKeyMLS.com

The real estate professionals who maintain their listings in OneKey® MLS feature them on OneKeyMLS.com, the consumer property search portal that features homes for rent and sale, as well as commercial listings. Every listing features only the listing agent, so you know who you’re dealing with when you decide to inquire about any listing on our site.

#### Accurate to the last detail

The professionals who represent the listings on OneKey® MLS are committed to ensuring that their listings are accurate and complete, and kept up-to-date. That means that when the listing says it’s for sale or rent, it really is, which is important in a fast-moving market like New York. What’s more, every listing our real estate professionals represent is entered into our system within 24 hours, so you can trust that the information you get from OneKey® MLS is accurate and timely.

#### Built for collaboration

When you work with an agent from OneKey® MLS, you'll collaborate in the OneHome™ Portal. This all-in-one portal enables you and your agent to share listings, exchange information, and makes your search experience organized and streamlined. You can search on your own, filter by map criteria like zip code and school boundaries, and categorize your listings by favorite or dislike. You'll even have the opportunity to set preferences for a predictive fit for listings usings PropertyFit and learn about the buying or selling process with Planner.

#### Standardized data, better listings

OneKey® MLS believes the real estate industry works better for consumers when it works together to eliminate hurdles to finding homes. That’s why OneKey® MLS is a leading participant in the Real Estate Standards Organization (RESO), which sets standards for the quality and normalization of real estate data nationwide. Every consumer benefits because standardized listings are easier to find, sort, and compare — the functions everyone cares about most when trying to buy or rent a home.
