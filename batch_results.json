From the moment you sign up, Cloud CMA takes it from there. All you have to do is select your listing, your comps and choose a design. Cloud CMA automatically pulls in the data, formats everything, and enables you to easily add your commentary to the report.\n\n#### Real, substantial, and gorgeous\n\nSometimes, people want the real thing. A real printed CMA that you can fully white label to comply with your brand. Add your logo, fonts, headshot, and even a cover letter to the seller. An aerial view of the seller's neighborhood is added to the cover, but you can replace it with your own image. The printed CMA is filled with more than 35 pages of expert pre-written educational content, so you don't have to lift a finger. Not to mention maps, charts, and the comps you've selected.[See a sample](https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/files/uploaded/Cloud-CMA-Sample.pdf).\n\n#### Flexible and modern\n\nNot everyone presents in person. Cloud CMA is designed so that it can be used as an online interactive presentation tool, using Zoom, Skype, or Hangouts. It looks great no matter what device you use. Draw attention to the neighborhoods you want to showcase, or flip through your CMA. Compare listings side-by-side. Condense your data into a list so it's easy to analyze onscreen. You can even add or remove comps on the fly with your clients, just to see how it affects the scenarios you're talking through with your clients. Embed that video you took the other day to explain why a specific listing is priced the way it is. It's your show ... make the most of it.\n\n#### White label design\n\nMake the design your own with easy and beautiful cover designs and interior templates that marry perfectly with your brand. Add your logo, set your brand colors, and your CMA is custom to you. You can also add custom content pages to ensure that your CMA is unique, in addition to the expert content that is already included with every Cloud CMA.\n\n#### Stay in touch\n\nSend Automatic CMAs with Cloud CMA's Homebeat (included in your premium package) to your clients once they're settled in to keep them informed about the market. Use real comps — not an automated valuation model — to let them know how their home is performing in the market. Keep your name top of mind.\n\n#### Optional Text and Email Alerts for Listings\n\nLone Wolf, the owner of Cloud CMA also offers Cloud Streams, an online real time listing alert service. When you use Cloud Streams with Cloud CMA, you can set up text or email alerts for your clients to notify them about new listings. Cloud Stream's email alerts are branded to you, are easy to scan on a mobile device because they feature large photos and highlight what's important about a listing. They also enable clients to provide instant feedback within the email itself.  You can track what your clients like in your private Cloud Streams portal, to identify trends, view their comments, and review a weekly activity summary. To sign up for Cloud Streams, visit[CloudCMA.com](https://cloudcma.com/).\n\n### Homebeat from Cloud CMA\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cloud-cma)\n\n### Virtual CMA Presentation from Cloud CMA\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cloud-cma)\n\n### Comps from Cloud CMA\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cloud-cma)\n\n### Cloud Streams Email Alert\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cloud-cma)\n\n#### Popular Features\n\n##### White label\n\n- Customizable with logo, fonts, color, content\n- Integrated with OneKey® MLS listing data\n\n\n##### Virtual presentation tools\n\n- Works with Zoom, Skype, or Hangouts\n- Fully responsive\n- Interactive and fun\n\n##### Automatic CMAs\n\n- Updates clients about values and market without utilizing AVM\n- Stay top of mind with previous clients\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [MarketStats by ShowingTime](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/marketstats)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Cloud CMA Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27233541523860-Cloud-CMA-Resources)\n- [Explore Product Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

With CubiCasa, buyers can better understand the home’s square footage, layout, and flow to know if it will suit their needs\n\n[CubiCasa Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27215908506516-CubiCasa-Resources)\n\n## Capture more leads.\n\n#### Drive traffic and engagement\n\nEight in 10 consumers say they are more likely to view a home if it has a floor plan. According to the National Association of REALTORS®, consumers rank floor plans and virtual tours as “very useful” features and spend more time online with listings that include them.\n\n#### Make listings memorable\n\nWhile photos illustrate the look of a listing, floor plans inform the spatial “feel” of a place in a way an image never can. Floor plans enable consumers to move from room to room so they can grasp the entire space from a bird's eye view, and make every listing memorable.\n\n#### Get more qualified buyers\n\nBuyers who look at floor plans know if a listing will work for them — so they don’t waste your time on listings that aren’t right. Floor plans help buyers qualify themselves.\n\n#### Scan to create your floor plan in five minutes\n\nUse your mobile device to scan the listing to generate a professional, sophisticated floor plan that includes room dimensions, fixed furniture, and total square footage. Style it and include your logo. Download the results in 6-24 hours, and insert into your MLS listing.\n\n#### Create your account to get started\n\nEvery real estate professional can use CubiCasa LITE as part of their OneKey® MLS subscription. To create your account, visit the[CubiCasa website](https://www.cubi.casa/), and download the mobile app to get started. You can also upgrade your CubiCasa plan at a special OneKey® MLS-only rate to take advantage of even more functionality in the mobile app. You can also save 10% when you reach 20 or more paid scans per month, and all paid add-ons count towards the volume discount.\n\n### Primary Benefits of a Floor Plan\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cubicasa)\n\n### Sample Floor Plan\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cubicasa)\n\n#### Popular Features\n\n##### Customizable floor plan models\n\n- Unlimited 2D black and white floor plans included in OneKey® MLS subscription\n- Gross living area up to 5,000 sq. ft.\n- Available with or without dimensions\n\n##### As easy as taking a picture\n\n- No blueprints or drawings required\n- Zero technical expertise necessary\n- Add your logo and customize colors\n\n##### Works with any listing\n\n- Scan any listing with your smart phone (iOS or Android)\n- Capture listing/floor plan highlights with snapshots\n- Download your floor plan in 6-24 hours\n- File output PNG or JPG\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [Cloud CMA](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cloud-cma)\n- [MLS-Touch®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/mls-touch)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [CubiCasa Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27215908506516-CubiCasa-Resources)\n- [Explore Product Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

Looking for owners likely to sell? Identifying short sales for investors? If you want to grow your business with data, OneKey® MLS has the tools to help you win.\n\n#### Farming has never been easier\n\nWhen you put Remine Pro to work to build your farm, start by identifying the neighborhood, subdivision, or zip code you want to focus on. Remine can offer signals about homeowners including whether they have lots of equity (mortgage maturity), have lived in their home more than seven years (ownership tenure), or don't live there at all (absentee, landlords or out-of-state owners), all of which can indicate that they may be ready to sell. Utilize Remine's predictive analytics to identify the homeowners on your list that are statistically more likely to sell in the next 4-6 months. Now, save your list of potential sellers. This targeted marketing list can be exported to Excel or CSV format, and you can use it to create a highly effective and efficient multi-channel marketing campaign. Best of all, your list will update when changes occur.\n\n#### Generate leads for your listings\n\nThere are 43,000 agents who participate in OneKey® MLS, and more than a million listings in our system. When you enter your new listing into Matrix™, you canreverse prospectfor buyers agents who have clients looking for listings just like yours. How? When clients' of buyer's agents save searches in Matrix™, the data is cross-referenced against any listing that is also made available for reverse prospecting. Then you, as the listing agent, can look for a list of buyer's agents whose clients have saved searches that match your property. This list shows the buyer’s agent's contact information but keeps the client’s identity confidential. This way, instead of waiting for buyer's agents to find your listing, you can proactively contact them and generate leads for your listing in the OneKey® MLS network. Instead of casting a wide net, you can target the most engaged buyers who are already in contract with an agent.\n\n#### Get leads from New Yorkers and beyond\n\nMillions of consumers visit OneKeyMLS.com every month to shop for new homes. Whether they're for sale or rent, or commercial properties, consumers spend an average of up to 10 minutes a session on their mobile devices on the site, and they look at 6-8 listings during their visit. About 85 percent of the traffic for OneKeyMLS.com is from the New York Metropolitan area. That translates into thousands of local leads for OneKey® MLS agents and brokers, all of which are sent directly to the listing agent and their broker. So when you see an email from OneKeyMLS.com in your inbox, open it. It's an inquiry from a consumer about your listing, courtesy of OneKey® MLS.\n\n#### Create data-driven leads\n\nThe comprehensive public records and real estate data in Realist® can create a steady pipeline of potential leads, whether you specialize in residential sales or probate, foreclosure or bank-owned/REO properties. Realist®'s enormous variety of filters, from properties with recently paid-off mortgages, recent value increases, or homeowners with high equity, represent just a fraction of the opportunities to be found. Realist®'s deep data can also reveal many other events that may negatively affect the property but present an opportunity to help a homeowner in distress, such as probate, delinquent taxes, and pre-foreclosure. No matter what type of business you want to develop, Realist® can help you focus on it and optimize your lead generation efforts. Once you've defined your farm, save it, export it to an Excel or CSV, and start marketing to it.\n\n### Remine Pro Advanced Filters\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/lead-generation)\n\n### Remine Pro Prospecting by Home Equity\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/lead-generation)\n\n### Remine Pro Ownership Time\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/lead-generation)\n\n### Remine Pro Prospecting by Multiple Factors\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/lead-generation)\n\n### Realist® Prospecting with Comps\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/lead-generation)\n\n### Matrix™ Hotsheet\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/lead-generation)\n\n### Realist® Sell Score\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/lead-generation)\n\nView more\n\n#### Did You Know?\n\n##### Data-driven lead generation\n\n- Predictive analytics can predict when a homeowner is likely to sell\n- Reverse prospecting matches your listing to prospective buyers\n- OneKeyMLS.com delivers free leads to OneKey® MLS professionals\n- Data mining can deliver a consistent flow of leads to agents\n- Specific criteria and trend-spotting against your business type yields more efficient targeted marketing\n\n##### Easy to use and integrate\n\n- Remine Pro, Matrix™ and Realist® export saved searches to Excel or CSV files\n- Easy to upload into your CRM\n- Realist® exports saved lists to mailing labels\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [OneKeyMLS.com](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/onekeymls)\n- [Realist](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/realist) [®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/realist)\n- [Remine Pro](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/remine-pro)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660072338452-Lead-Generation)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York.

Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"description":"Recognized for the second year in a row, Haggerty and Spagnulo say OneKey® MLS and LIBOR work together to bring innovation to members.","title":"\n    \n    LI Business News Name Haggerty & Spagnuolo 2025 Real Estate Influencers\n  \n  ","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","og:description":"Recognized for the second year in a row, Haggerty and Spagnulo say OneKey® MLS and LIBOR work together to bring innovation to members.","twitter:title":"LI Business News Name Haggerty & Spagnuolo 2025 Real Estate Influencers","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-29894233-f38b940d-1920w.png","article:published_time":"2025-03-20T19:06Z","twitter:description":"Recognized for the second year in a row, Haggerty and Spagnulo say OneKey® MLS and LIBOR work together to bring innovation to members.","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/long-island-business-news-names-richard-haggerty-2025-real-estate-and-construction-influencer","ogDescription":"Recognized for the second year in a row, Haggerty and Spagnulo say OneKey® MLS and LIBOR work together to bring innovation to members.","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/long-island-business-news-names-richard-haggerty-2025-real-estate-and-construction-influencer","ogTitle":"LI Business News Name Haggerty & Spagnuolo 2025 Real Estate Influencers","og:title":"LI Business News Name Haggerty & Spagnuolo 2025 Real Estate Influencers","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-29894233-f38b940d-1920w.png","og:type":"article","language":"en","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-29894233-f38b940d-1920w.png","scrapeId":"a26d4b9c-9f42-468c-a75a-caf6869ac6e0","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/long-island-business-news-names-richard-haggerty-2025-real-estate-and-construction-influencer","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/long-island-business-news-names-richard-haggerty-2025-real-estate-and-construction-influencer","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","Housing","Innovation","Market Insights"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025","title":"OneKey® MLS","description":"OneKey® MLS is one of the nation's leading Multiple Listing Services, serving tens of thousands of real estate professionals across Long Island, New York City, and the Hudson Valley.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

I cannot imagine any real estate company or agent wanting to repeat that experience. However, suppose brokers actively encourage sellers to accept more limited listing exposure for their benefit as opposed to the sellers’ benefit — in the words of Yogi Berra, it could be déjà vu all over again.\n\nI believe it’s tough to argue against more visibility of a listing benefiting home sellers and prospective buyers alike. I also think that submission of listings to the MLS promotes fair housing principles and equal access to housing, where selected or limited marketing of listings can lead to potential discrimination, even if unintentional.\n\nIn this instance, I don’t think it is necessary to focus solely on mandatory rules; instead, focus on doing what is right for the consumer. That means providing the consumer with all available options for achieving their goals and following all lawful instructions to help them achieve them.\n\nAgain, if brokers steer them in directions that benefit the brokers’ interests above the consumer’s interest, we have a problem, and in my opinion, a big problem.\n\nThe other aspect of this conversation that we cannot ignore is the potential impact on data integrity. Complete, current, accurate, and timely real property data is the foundation of the MLS and facilitates a transparent marketplace that benefits brokers and consumers alike. If you don’t have complete, accurate, and timely data, think of the impact that would have on CMAs and appraisals. I think the ripple effect will go much further.\n\n![Richard Haggerty, CEO, OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Richard-Haggerty-600x440-1920w.jpg)\n\nSuppose brokers selectively withhold listings from the MLS for a period of time. In that case, prospective purchasers will not have access to those properties unless they work directly with the listing office, forgoing any existing relationship they may have with their buyer’s agent. Again, suggesting that a prospective purchaser forgo the representation of their choice to access the listed property is problematic.\n\n#### Change is Inevitable. Let's do What's Right.\n\nWe live and work in a time where the inclination is to tear down systems and institutions that have served us well for years if not decades. As I’ve said numerous times, I’m not a fan of the status quo, as I think change is inevitable and necessary. However, I come from a perspective of how we can improve the systems we have in place instead of weakening the effectiveness of those systems. The real estate industry must realize the consequences of such actions, and we must always be willing to do what’s right, not what is self-serving.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"title":"\n    \n    Doing the Right Thing\n  \n  ","description":"OneKey® MLS is the 10th largest MLS in the United States.

Find out where buyers are located, compare your listing to the performance of similar listings, and take stock of how your listing stacks up. If your listing isn't garnering the attention it deserves, you'll have the data points necessary to have an objective discussion with your client about resetting the price. Down the line, you can also see if the modifications you make had the desired effect, and present the results in a client-friendly report that illustrates where your listing got the most exposure.\n\n#### Track performance everywhere\n\nListTrac tracks listing traffic on top portals, including Zillow, Realtor.com, and Homes.com, as well as on broker sites. Just as important, your seller can see the hits your listing receives within the MLS itself, which signals strong buyer interest in your personal network and can indicate how tight inventory is for your type of listing.\n\n#### Meaningful reporting\n\nAll ListTrac reports are co-branded with your brokerage's brand, and include content that is co-developed to help clients understand the importance of internet marketing. Bold graphics present views by week and month, and comparison charts enable you to show your listing's performance against other properties. The report also shows the number of leads generated, times the listing was favorited and shared across sites, and where your listing got the most traffic and exposure.\n\n#### Counting the hits in Matrix™\n\nUnderstand how your listing is performing in the market and set your client's expectations properly with Matrix's built-in Hit Counter, which is found in the listing detail page. You can see how many times agents and clients have viewed your listing. Agent views indicate how much interest there is from your peers, while client views show how many buyers have received the listing through automated searches or directly from their agent. Use the Hit Counter to benchmark performance. If a listing is getting a lot of views, but isn't converting all that interest into offers, it might be time to have a conversation about a price reduction or beef up your advertising campaign. You can also use the Hit Counter to gauge the effect of any adjustments you've made to your listing. If hits spike after you add new photography or pour on the Facebook advertising, you'll know those strategies worked and can plan accordingly. While the Hit Counter is a great performance monitor, it's intentionally anonymous. It only provides the number of agent and client views. Agents can't contact clients who have viewed their listings directly, and need to contact the buyer's agent if they're interested.\n\n### Matrix™ Hit Counter\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/performance-validation)\n\n#### Did You Know?\n\n##### Track listing traffic everywhere\n\n- Find out which portals and broker sites create the greatest traction for your listings in terms of views, favorites, shares and leads\n\n##### Count hits in the MLS\n\n- Keep track of industry exposure in Matrix via agent hits on your listing, and how many times they send your listing to their clients\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [ListTrac](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/listtrac)\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix) ﻿\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660140077204-Performance-Validation)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

Condominiums also saw an uptick, with a closed median sale price of $480,000, reflecting a 3.9% increase from $462,000 the previous year. The closed median sale price for co-ops rose to $279,750, a modest 1.5% increase from $275,500 in July 2023.\n\nWhen looking at transaction volumes, closed sales for single-family homes and condominiums were both up compared to last year, while co-op sales saw a decline. There were 3,625 single-family closed transactions in July 2024, a 4.4% increase over July 2023. Condominium closed sales reached 533, up by 6.8%, while co-op closed sales dropped by 6.4% to 528.\n\nInventory continues to play a crucial role in the real estate market, influencing prices, buyer demand, and the pace of sales. In July 2024, new listings for single-family homes rose compared to the same time last year, with 4,634 new listings versus 4,424 in July 2023. Conversely, new listings for condos and co-ops decreased, with 773 condo listings (down 14.4%) and 819 co-op listings (down 16.8%) compared to the previous year.\n\nRichard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, commented on the current market dynamics, stating, “The rise in median sale prices reflects strong demand, particularly in the single-family home segment, despite fluctuations in inventory levels. As we look ahead, the potential for declining mortgage rates could reignite buyer enthusiasm, especially for those who have been on the fence due to higher borrowing costs. A decrease in rates could bring more buyers back into the market, stimulating activity across various property types.”\n\nOneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from 12 counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Blog-Placeholder-1920w.jpg","title":"\n    \n    NY Regional Single-Family Home Price Increases 8.9% in July 2024\n  \n  ","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Blog-Placeholder-1920w.jpg","description":"OneKey® MLS reported significant trends in July 2024 that bode well for the region’s housing market.

This continues to be made possible by the expert guidance and leadership provided by the OneKey MLS Board of Managers. The addition of Tom Hurdelbrink adds a new dimension and brings a wealth of experience to the governing Board of OneKey MLS.\n\nTom Hurdelbrink has served as President and CEO of NWMLS, a groundbreaking MLS that serves 35,000 Realtor® and non-Realtor licensees across Washington State and beyond.  For the past 15 years, he has overseen the strategic direction and delivery of member policies, fostered  ethical relationships, and championed the implementation of technological innovation for the real estate industry at large. Most recently, Tom was named the 2023 CMLS Peter Shuttleworth CMLS Executive of the Year.\n\nTom brings passion and a proven record of excellence with MLS initiatives. Richard Haggerty, OneKey MLS CEO said, “In getting to know Tom, I see how his talents align with our strategic pursuit to empower subscribers by curating products and building on services that support their success.”\n\nJoining Tom on the OneKey MLS Board of Managers are two incumbents who have served as Outside Managers for OneKey MLS since inception. Alon Chaver, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and industry tech and brokerage executive, brings contemporary sensibility to the boardroom. His focus is on strengthening the relationships between participants and subscribers and the consumers they serve. Travis Conway guides the MLS in creating a more satisfying user experience. As an expert in data aggregation and reporting across multiple industries, he uses out-of-the-box thinking and analytical insights to drive effective data applications.\n\nThese three specialists will serve as Outside Managers alongside ten seasoned MLS participants who volunteer their time to represent their respective regions and govern the MLS. Chairperson Frank DellAccio, Vice Chairperson Mark Boyland, Leah Caro, Melissa Gomez, Pati Holmes, and Linda Lugo return to serve on the Board of Managers in 2024, alongside newly appointed Managers Christopher Bacchus, Jason Furnari, Moses Seuram, and Mary Stetson. The combined collaborative efforts, unique viewpoints, industry experience and ingenuity of the Managers and Outside Managers assembled ensures OneKey MLS is in a position to adapt to the wave of change facing our industry.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS).

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-of-managers-welcomes-tom-hurdelbrink-veteran-real-estate-industry-leader","language":"en","twitter:title":"OneKey® MLS NamesTom Hurdelbrink to Board of Managers","ogTitle":"OneKey® MLS NamesTom Hurdelbrink to Board of Managers","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-of-managers-welcomes-tom-hurdelbrink-veteran-real-estate-industry-leader","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Tom-Hurdelbrink-1920w.png","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","og:type":"article","title":"\n    \n    OneKey® MLS NamesTom Hurdelbrink to Board of Managers\n  \n  ","twitter:description":"OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, is pleased to announce the appointment of Tom Hurdelbrink, President and CEO of Northwest MLS (NWMLS), to serve as an Outside Manager on its Board of Managers for 2024.","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Tom-Hurdelbrink-1920w.png","og:description":"OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, is pleased to announce the appointment of Tom Hurdelbrink, President and CEO of Northwest MLS (NWMLS), to serve as an Outside Manager on its Board of Managers for 2024.","og:title":"OneKey® MLS NamesTom Hurdelbrink to Board of Managers","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Tom-Hurdelbrink-1920w.png","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","article:published_time":"2023-12-21T22:52Z","description":"OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, is pleased to announce the appointment of Tom Hurdelbrink, President and CEO of Northwest MLS (NWMLS), to serve as an Outside Manager on its Board of Managers for 2024.","ogDescription":"OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, is pleased to announce the appointment of Tom Hurdelbrink, President and CEO of Northwest MLS (NWMLS), to serve as an Outside Manager on its Board of Managers for 2024.","scrapeId":"9b1006ce-76fb-4f01-b31d-e50337acd310","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-of-managers-welcomes-tom-hurdelbrink-veteran-real-estate-industry-leader","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-of-managers-welcomes-tom-hurdelbrink-veteran-real-estate-industry-leader","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","New York","Housing","Technology","Community"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025","title":"OneKey® MLS","description":"OneKey MLS is the largest MLS in New York, providing a comprehensive real estate marketplace for subscribers and consumers.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-stands-with-rrf-to-help-california-wildfire-victims","description":"OneKey® MLS is proud to support the Realtor® Relief Foundation (RRF) initiative to aid those impacted by the California wildfires.","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","og:description":"OneKey® MLS is proud to support the Realtor® Relief Foundation (RRF) initiative to aid those impacted by the California wildfires.","ogTitle":"OneKey® MLS Stands with RRF to Help California Wildfire Victims","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-stands-with-rrf-to-help-california-wildfire-victims","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/realtors-relief-foundation-logo-2-1920w.jpg","og:type":"article","twitter:description":"OneKey® MLS is proud to support the Realtor® Relief Foundation (RRF) initiative to aid those impacted by the California wildfires.","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/realtors-relief-foundation-logo-2-1920w.jpg","title":"\n    \n    OneKey® MLS Stands with RRF to Help California Wildfire Victims\n  \n  ","twitter:title":"OneKey® MLS Stands with RRF to Help California Wildfire Victims","article:published_time":"2025-02-10T18:00Z","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:title":"OneKey® MLS Stands with RRF to Help California Wildfire Victims","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/realtors-relief-foundation-logo-2-1920w.jpg","language":"en","ogDescription":"OneKey® MLS is proud to support the Realtor® Relief Foundation (RRF) initiative to aid those impacted by the California wildfires.","scrapeId":"09b30eaf-0f23-4705-bd30-c15d870e4474","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-stands-with-rrf-to-help-california-wildfire-victims","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-stands-with-rrf-to-help-california-wildfire-victims","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","Housing","Support","Community","Education"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025","title":"OneKey® MLS","description":"OneKey® MLS is the largest multiple listing service in New York, providing support and resources for real estate professionals.

Condominium prices also saw a modest rise, with a closed median sale price of $515,000, up 3.6% year-over-year. In contrast, the co-op market experienced a decline, with a closed median sale price of $285,000, down 5% from $300,000 in the same period last year.\n\nTransactional sales activity remained relatively steady for single-family homes, with closed sales rising 1.4% year-over-year. Meanwhile, closed sales for condominiums and co-ops declined by 4.7% and 8.8%, respectively.\n\nOver the past year, real estate prices across the region have shown varied trends, with some counties experiencing steady growth and others marked by fluctuations. Westchester County consistently leads the market with the highest median sale prices, peaking at $1,031,500 in June 2024 before settling at $860,000 in March 2025. Queens and Nassau also remain strong markets, with median prices consistently in the $800K+ range, showing moderate growth and relative stability.\n\nIn contrast, Sullivan County represents the more affordable end of the market, with notable volatility—rising from $290,000 in March 2024 to $390,000 in February 2025, then dropping to $355,000 in March 2025. Bronx prices saw a recent spike to $710,000, the highest in over a year, suggesting renewed demand or limited inventory.\n\nCounties like Putnam, Orange, and Dutchess displayed moderate price shifts, generally ranging from the mid-$400Ks to mid-$500Ks, with signs of stabilization in early 2025. These areas may appeal to buyers seeking more affordability without straying too far from downstate urban centers.\n\n\"As we move into the spring market, we're seeing renewed activity across several counties, particularly in the Bronx and Queens,\" said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS. \"While pricing trends remain varied, the overall market continues to show a steady demand across a wide range of price points.\"\n\nFor more detailed regional and county-based statistics about residential, condo, and co-op sales transactions, please visit[**marketstats.onekeymls.com**](https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/)\n\n**About OneKey® MLS**\n\nOneKey® MLS is one of the nation's leading Multiple Listing Services, serving tens of thousands of real estate professionals across Long Island, New York City, and the Hudson Valley.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

Condominiums reported a closed median sale price of $530,400, reflecting a 12.9% increase from the same price reported a year ago. The closed median sale price for co-ops was $295,000, a 1.7% increase from $290,000 in February 2024.\n\nIn terms of transactional activity, closed sales for single-family homes, condominiums and co-op sales were down compared to last year. There was a total of 2,117 single-family closed transactions in February 2024, which is 3.8% less than February 2024. Condominium closed sales were 385 and co-op sales were 419, marking 13.3% and 23.3% declines respectively.\n\nRichard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, commented on the current market conditions, stating, \"The real estate market continues to see rising prices, with single-family home prices up 9.2% year-over-year. However, closed sales have declined by 3.8%, and inventory remains lower by 8.8%, which has kept competition high. While the market presents challenges for buyers, those who are well-prepared can still find opportunities.\"\n\nOneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from the counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"title":"\n    \n    Home Prices Climb as Sales Decline: February Market Remains Competitive\n  \n  ","ogTitle":"Home Prices Climb as Sales Decline: February Market Remains Competitive","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:type":"article","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","article:published_time":"2025-03-18T15:34Z","og:description":"(Farmingdale, NY) March 18, 2025 – OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for February 2025 reflecting a competitive market that continues to favor sellers.","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/February+2025+Market+Snapshot+16-9-1920w.png","ogDescription":"(Farmingdale, NY) March 18, 2025 – OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for February 2025 reflecting a competitive market that continues to favor sellers.","description":"(Farmingdale, NY) March 18, 2025 – OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for February 2025 reflecting a competitive market that continues to favor sellers.","language":"en","twitter:description":"(Farmingdale, NY) March 18, 2025 – OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for February 2025 reflecting a competitive market that continues to favor sellers.","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","twitter:title":"Home Prices Climb as Sales Decline: February Market Remains Competitive","og:title":"Home Prices Climb as Sales Decline: February Market Remains Competitive","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/February+2025+Market+Snapshot+16-9-1920w.png","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/home-prices-climb-as-sales-decline-february-market-remains-competitive","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/home-prices-climb-as-sales-decline-february-market-remains-competitive","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/February+2025+Market+Snapshot+16-9-1920w.png","scrapeId":"ca1de690-f1f9-4cc1-9e40-62999b37bebd","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/home-prices-climb-as-sales-decline-february-market-remains-competitive","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/home-prices-climb-as-sales-decline-february-market-remains-competitive","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","Market Report","Statistics","Housing","MLS"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735","id":"onekey-mls-2025-03-18","title":"Home Prices Climb as Sales Decline: February Market Remains Competitive","description":"OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for February 2025 reflecting a competitive market that continues to favor sellers. In February, the regional single-family closed median sale price was $710,000, marking a 9.2% year-over-year increase from $650,000 reported in February 2025. Condominiums reported a closed median sale price of $530,400, reflecting a 12.9% increase from the same price reported a year ago. The closed median sale price for co-ops was $295,000, a 1.7% increase from $290,000 in February 2024. In terms of transactional activity, closed sales for single-family homes, condominiums and co-op sales were down compared to last year. There was a total of 2,117 single-family closed transactions in February 2024, which is 3.8% less than February 2024. Condominium closed sales were 385 and co-op sales were 419, marking 13.3% and 23.3% declines respectively. Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, commented on the current market conditions, stating, \"The real estate market continues to see rising prices, with single-family home prices up 9.2% year-over-year. However, closed sales have declined by 3.8%, and inventory remains lower by 8.8%, which has kept competition high. While the market presents challenges for buyers, those who are well-prepared can still find opportunities.\" OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from the counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

Richard's career has taken him through many geographical stomping grounds, but it is the character of New York that he embodies. That New York resilience and resourcefulness has led him to serve in leadership positions over four decades at both local, state, and national REALTOR® association levels and at two multiple listing systems (MLSs). He has served on numerous committees, including the Professional Standards Committee and the Association Executive Committee of the National Association of REALTORS®. He has been named as one of the Swanepoel Top 200 as one of the most powerful and influential executives in the residential real estate brokerage industry.\n\n﻿\n\nRichard has offered his guidance and stewardship on behalf of the goal of homeownership throughout his career leading him to be inducted into the Dr. Almon R. (Bud) Smith, RCE, AE Leadership Society of the National Association of REALTORS®, Inc in 2015. His empire state of mind confidently carried him through the inception of OneKey® and has helped develop OneKey® MLS into a solution that is uniquely positioned to help its customers thrive in a highly competitive and fast-paced market with constant forward momentum, a fluid strategy that finds opportunity in each iteration. It finds strength in diversity, possibility in change, and anticipates the unique needs that this culturally rich melting pot of a marketplace requires: from the “black dirt” farms of Orange County to the high rises or Manhattan, to the waterfront villages of Long Island. With Richard at the helm OneKey® MLS, they’re raising the bar for those they serve--real estate professionals and consumers alike-- reaching out for new, next, and best, knowing the status quo is not an option.\n\nDescribed by his contemporaries as a “thoughtful visionary,” Richard’s comportment is distinguished by a personal dignity and respect for fellow individuals from all walks of life. He listens more than he speaks, but when he speaks, the content is considered, to-the-point, and his audience leans in so as not to miss what he has to say. A passionate and powerful speaker, who mixes gravitas with humor skillfully, Richard’s experience as a national and state instructor is displayed in his engaging presentation style and you’ll find him leading at local and industry events. His members trust and respect him and you’ll find him equally considered in his attention to a member’s concern as to a fellow executive’s greeting. Richard brings to bear the well-earned trust of his community — a feat not achieved overnight and built on a foundation of performance, integrity, and engaged listening. Richard knows how to facilitate and bring divergent concerns into alignment and exhibit willingness to put himself on the line and put himself out there in pursuit of the best outcomes for his 45,000+ customers and consumers in the Metropolitan New York Area that OneKey® MLS serves as exhibited in the 2023 acquisition of Mid-Hudson MLS.\n\n[Return to Staff](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/staff)\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/richard-haggerty","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/social-networks-image-onekey-logo-1920w.png","og:title":"Richard Haggerty CEO | OneKey® MLS","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/richard-haggerty","ogDescription":"Richard Haggerty is the CEO of OneKey® MLS, where he has transformed the MLS into a service to create opportunities to help its 43,000 customers succeed.","og:description":"Richard Haggerty is the CEO of OneKey® MLS, where he has transformed the MLS into a service to create opportunities to help its 43,000 customers succeed.","twitter:title":"Richard Haggerty CEO | OneKey® MLS","title":"\n    \n    Richard Haggerty CEO | OneKey® MLS\n  \n  ","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/social-networks-image-onekey-logo-1920w.png","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/social-networks-image-onekey-logo-1920w.png","og:type":"website","description":"Richard Haggerty is the CEO of OneKey® MLS, where he has transformed the MLS into a service to create opportunities to help its 43,000 customers succeed.","language":"en","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:description":"Richard Haggerty is the CEO of OneKey® MLS, where he has transformed the MLS into a service to create opportunities to help its 43,000 customers succeed.","ogTitle":"Richard Haggerty CEO | OneKey® MLS","scrapeId":"7d4850c6-89dc-4d72-b779-4785a90219d3","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/richard-haggerty","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/richard-haggerty","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":[],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls","title":"OneKey® MLS","description":"OneKey® MLS provides solutions for real estate professionals, including branding, marketing, client collaboration, lead generation, and more.

OneKey® MLS has all the tools you need to support both sides of the equation\n\n[Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660074786324-Property-Valuation)\n\n### When the seller looks you in the eye and asks you \"WHY?\" we've got your back with tools, data, and analysis to explain.\n\n#### There are comps ... and then there arecomps\n\nEveryone knows selecting comparable properties to the subject propertyseemseasy, until it's not. You need to look for recent sales, as well as homes that are similar in square footage, size, age, and condition. You need at least five or more, preferably, active and expired, to average out the pricing. What if it's a hot market? Ornot? What if there's just no comparable inventory? All of a sudden, those comps are not easy at all. That's where OneKey® MLS's suite of CMA tools makes your job a whole lot better. Use Matrix™ to pull active and pending listings, as well as historical sales data. Then complement those comps with an analysis from Realist®. That's where you can find in-depth public records, long-term property and tax data, and pricing trends that can help you accurately value your subject property and complement the active, pending, and recently sold properties in the MLS aren't quite right. Check out Remine Pro if you want to overlay other potential sellers (unearthed by predictive analytics) into your CMA, which can influence the valuation you ultimately agree on with your seller.\n\n#### Finally, a helpful automated valuation\n\nAutomated valuation models are phenomenal conversation-starters, but they're often wrong and cause everyone headaches. When it comes to valuing your seller's property, Realtors Property Resource® (RPR®)'s Realtor Valuation Model® is a proprietary algorithm exclusive to REALTORS® based on MLS data and public records that is specifically designed to counteract AVMs that wildly over- or underestimate a property's value. The RVM® differs from a traditional AVM because it integrates real-time MLS data (including active, pending, and sold listings), it can produce more accurate property valuations compared to standard AVMs that rely solely on public records. MLS data allows the RVM® to consider more detailed property characteristics (e.g., condition, upgrades) that might not be reflected in public records. This makes the RVM® a more precise tool for estimating current market value. Most important, you, as the agent, can adjust the RVM® using your expertise and local knowledge, so you can refine the valuation further before presenting it to your seller. The RVM® works for you builds the seller's confidence by demonstrating your pricing expertise, giving you a competitive edge.\n\n#### Beautiful branded presentations\n\nWhen it comes time to present your findings to your seller and win your listing presentation, you have plenty of options. You can create a handsome CMA in either Realist® or Remine Pro, or use a premium theme from Cloud CMA with pre-written content you can customize. Simply pull in your listings, select your data points, and drop in your logo, headshot and brand colors, and prepare to wow your seller with the depth of your expertise and insights.\n\n### Realist® Advanced Map Layers\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\n### Realist® Comps\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\n### RPR RVM®\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\n### RPR® Property Detail with RVM®\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\n### RPR Realtor Valuation Model®\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\n### Remine Overview\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\n### Remine Property Detail\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\n### Cloud CMA Comps\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/property-valuation)\n\nView more\n\n#### Did You Know?\n\n##### Valuations made easy\n\n- Use custom filters to find similar properties in size, age, condition\n- Back up price opinion with data from public records and tax\n- Utilize built-in CMA tools to easily share your presentation with clients\n\n##### RVM®: The AVM that works for you\n\n- Use the only automated valuation model that integrates MLS data and considers detailed property condition and upgrades\n- More accurate and flexible than standard AVMs because you can adjust it for local market conditions\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [Cloud CMA](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cloud-cma)\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [Realist®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/realist)\n- [Remine Pro](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/remine-pro)\n- [Realtors Property Resource®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/realtors-property-resource)\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Exp](https://support.onekeymls.com/) [lore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660074786324-Property-Valuation)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so please check back frequently. Your use of this website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.\n\nOneKey® MLS is committed to your privacy and security and wants to provide you with the best possible online experience. To that end, we want you to understand what kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used and safeguarded, and how you can control its use.\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers the following issues:\n\n#### What information is collected from me?\n\nThe kinds of information we collect from you will vary, depending on how you use our websites. Sometimes we will collect personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). For example, if you choose to take advantage of some of our products and services, you may be asked to provide information such as a user name and password, your real name, e-mail address, phone number, address, your real estate license or MLS ID# or, for certain e-commerce transactions, your credit card information.\n\nIn addition to the Personal Information you choose to submit, our systems are set up to gather certain data to help us to better understand how the site is being used and how we can improve it. This data may not be linked to you personally. This automatically gathered data includes your computer’s “Internet Protocol” (“IP”) address, statistics about how visitors navigate through our site and information provided through the use of cookies and web beacons (which is described in more detail below).\n\nFinally, when you visit our site, be aware that third parties may at times be able to gather information from you. For example, third party marketing companies and ad servers may use their own cookies, and companies offering products or services through OneKey® MLS sites may use their own cookies and may collect and use the information you submit. In these cases, the third parties may use your information according to their own privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.\n\n#### How is my information used?\n\nOneKey® MLS may use the information to:\n\n- Improve and customize the content and layout of our sites and other communication tools\n- Send you e-mail news updates\n- Notify you of relevant products and services\n- Track usage of our sites\n- Provide more relevant advertising on other websites\n- Notify you of upcoming OneKey® MLS events and programs\n\nThe use of your information depends on the context in which it is collected. The following sections describe in more detail the type of information that is collected and how it is used.\n\nAdditionally, we will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our policies; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Site(s) or third parties.\n\n#### Cookies, web beacons, and similar technology\n\nThese are small files that are sent to and stored on your computer so that we and third parties that provide services for our sites can recognize your computer as a unique machine the next time you visit our sites. This technology is used to keep track of your information for your own convenience; help us optimize your online experience by altering our content depending on your particular needs or browsing patterns; provide you with advertisements (on and off our site), products and services potentially of interest to you; help us understand the size of our audience and their traffic patterns within our network; and help us pursue similar goals. Some of our advertisers and third-party ad servers may also utilize their own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies, which are subject to their own privacy policies. Also, companies offering products or services through OneKey® MLS websites may use their own cookies, which are subject to their own privacy policies.\n\n#### Registration\n\nThe information you provide when you become a registered user to certain pages of our site is used primarily to help us customize your online experience. Your e-mail address serves as a unique identifier in our record system, and it is used together with your password to prevent unauthorized access to any information you choose to store on our sites. The data you give us about your personal preferences and demographics (such as age, zip code, occupation, or other data) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products and services that are most likely to appeal to you. In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their ads more effectively. By registering with any OneKey® MLS website, you are confirming that you are at least 18 years old or older.\n\nUnless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the e-mail address you provide at registration to contact you for promotional, administrative, or other reasons. You may have these communications terminated at any time. If you indicate that you’re interested in hearing from other companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose.\n\n#### Tools\n\nOur sites allow you to use many helpful tools, such as financial and home improvements calculators, real estate search tools, and others, without disclosing any Personal Information. These tools are for your benefit and the information you submit when you use them (typically impersonal data) is not disclosed to anyone or used for any purpose other than to provide you with the service you’re seeking.\n\n#### Registered User Services\n\nYou may choose to request products or services of a more substantial or personal nature when using our websites. You may store your preferences for convenience in using our sites or make an online purchase. The information you provide when seeking these services may be used in the following ways.\n\nFor services provided by OneKey® MLS websites, the information you submit is used by us to provide the service you’ve requested. We may also share this information with subcontractors, but only to the extent necessary to fulfill your request. In addition, we may use the contact information and nonfinancial order information you’ve supplied, such as your e-mail address, as set out in the Registration section above. If the service you request requires submission of financial information such as credit card number for an online purchase, rest assured that this financial information is used only for processing your payment, and is not retained after completion of your order unless you have given us the authority to make automatic payments on your credit card. In that event, your credit card information will be retained by us until you cancel your automatic payments. We may, however, store your nonfinancial order information for accounting purposes and to help us to understand your preferences better so that we can offer you future products or services that you may find useful.\n\n#### Credit Information\n\nCredit information that you and credit authorizers provide when you make payments by credit card for products or other services will only be used to process the transactions you request. This information will be provided to and maintained by reputable credit reporting databases, but will never be sold, shared or provided to other third parties.\n\n#### Purchasing Products and Managing Your Services\n\nFor products and services offered to you jointly by OneKey® MLS and a third party, your information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. You can tell when a product or service is offered by a third party, because a page of our site will be “co-branded” displaying the third party’s logo and/or name along with our own, or you will be linked to the third party’s site to complete the transaction.\n\nThird parties have their own policies regarding the use and protection of your information that may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your Personal Information might be used or protected by a third party, we encourage you to become familiar with that company’s privacy policy before using the service or requesting the product, or to not request the product or service.\n\n#### Solicited Information\n\nYou may occasionally see sweepstakes, surveys and other features of our site that ask you to provide us with Personal Information. When you choose to respond to these requests, the Personal Information you offer may be used for several purposes. These include the uses set out in the Registration section above. They also include providing information to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any sweepstakes or similar offerings.\n\n#### User Initiated Communication\n\nOur websites enable you to e-mail us or third parties and to participate in public bulletin boards and discussion groups. Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may expect to be contacted in return.\n\n#### Automatically Gathered Data\n\nThe information gathered automatically by our system-such as your computer’s IP address, the kind of browser you’re using, a record of your navigation through our site, and information obtained through cookies and web beacons-may be used by OneKey® MLS so we can understand how to make our sites convenient and useful to our audience, in addition to the other ways outlined in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may share this information with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their advertisements more effectively.\n\n#### Advertising\n\nSome of our sites contain advertising placed by advertising networks pursuant to the agreement between OneKey® MLS and the advertising network. We do not control these advertising networks, the sites of third parties reached through links on our site, or their information collection practices. OneKey® MLS is not responsible for the activities of these third parties. Third party advertisers may collect information from you that may be personally identifiable, and the third-party advertisers may conduct behavioral advertising.\n\nAdditionally, we employ a third-party ad service to help provide relevant ads to you on and off this site. Please see below (“How do I “opt out”?”) to opt out of such ad targeting.\n\n#### How do I “opt out” and limit information gathering?\n\nYou also can terminate e-mail correspondence from us at any time. You will either be given the chance to opt-out of direct mailings when you disclose your e-mail address to us or you can simply reply to our e-mail typing “Unsubscribe” in the subject line, or e-mail the appropriate webmaster below with your request and we will promptly remove your address from that e-mail service: [info@onekeymls.com](mailto:info@onekeymls.com)\n\nIf you feel concerned about the cookies that are sent between our computers and yours, you may, through your Web browser, either choose to reject them automatically, or have your computer prompt you before accepting them. Generally, this is done by selecting the appropriate cookies setting on your Web browser (usually found in “Internet Options” or “Preferences”). Please note, however, that some of our features and services depend on the use of cookies. Therefore, you will be unable to take advantage of those features if you choose not to accept cookies.\n\nThird party advertisers and websites may collect information from you and provide advertising based on that information. To opt out of such advertising from companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative, please go to [https://thenai.org/opt-out/](https://thenai.org/opt-out/).\n\n#### How is my information protected?\n\nWhenever Personal Information about you is stored on our computers, that information is password-protected from unauthorized access or use. In addition, this information is kept only on servers that are located behind a firewall.\n\nWe have additional security measures for financial information. We will only transmit or ask for this information over secure Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, the currently accepted standard for online security, and security keys. In addition, we require password authentication from any third parties you’ve authorized to receive this information. Finally, your credit card number and financial information are never stored on our servers. While this means you may have to enter this information more than once, we believe the added security is worth the extra effort.\n\nOf course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your own and others’ privacy. We hope you’ll use common sense whenever you disclose Personal Information over the Internet. Just as importantly, we encourage you to let us know immediately if you suspect that the information you share with us is being used in any way contrary to this Privacy Policy. To contact us, please send an e-mail to: [info@onekeymls.com](mailto:info@onekeymls.com).\n\n#### Scope of This Privacy Policy: Outside Links\n\nThis Privacy Policy only applies to sites owned and operated by OneKey® MLS. Our pages contain links to sites outside our control. Please be aware that these sites may collect information about you and operate according to their own privacy practices that may differ from this Privacy Policy. Remember that once you’re outside our websites, any information you submit is outside of our control.\n\n#### Disputes\n\nBy using our site, you agree that any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Site, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Privacy Statement or any part of it (“Dispute”) shall be resolved by a single impartial arbitrator pursuant to proceedings administered by the American Arbitration Association under its rules for resolution of commercial disputes. Any such Dispute shall be brought, in any arbitration or other legal proceeding, solely by you as an individual and not as part of, or as a representative of, a class. The arbitration shall be held in Nassau or Suffolk County, New York. All submissions to the arbitrator, the proceedings and the award shall be confidential. The arbitration shall be conducted on an expedited basis with minimal discovery. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding. The Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Suffolk and/or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over (a) any action concerning the enforcement of an arbitration award, or (b) if arbitration is not permitted by law, then any Dispute you have arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy. You agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts and you will not object to such jurisdiction and venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, inconvenient forum or otherwise. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey®

If it’s been bought or sold in our service area, one of our real estate professionals likely handled the transaction, and we have a record of it\n\n## 1M+ million Listings in Long Island, Manhattan, and the Hudson Valley.\n\n#### Wide geographic coverage\n\nOneKey® MLS serves 43,000 REALTORS® who work in Long Island, Manhattan, and the Lower Hudson Valley. We are the largest MLS in New York state, and the 10th largest MLS in the United States. Our scale gives us the ability to provide our real estate professionals with technology that helps their clients find the right home more quickly.\n\n#### OneKeyMLS.com\n\nThe real estate professionals who maintain their listings in OneKey® MLS feature them on OneKeyMLS.com, the consumer property search portal that features homes for rent and sale, as well as commercial listings. Every listing features only the listing agent, so you know who you’re dealing with when you decide to inquire about any listing on our site.\n\n#### Accurate to the last detail\n\nThe professionals who represent the listings on OneKey® MLS are committed to ensuring that their listings are accurate and complete, and kept up-to-date. That means that when the listing says it’s for sale or rent, it really is, which is important in a fast-moving market like New York. What’s more, every listing our real estate professionals represent is entered into our system within 24 hours, so you can trust that the information you get from OneKey® MLS is accurate and timely.\n\n#### Built for collaboration\n\nWhen you work with an agent from OneKey® MLS, you'll collaborate in the OneHome™ Portal. This all-in-one portal enables you and your agent to share listings, exchange information, and makes your search experience organized and streamlined. You can search on your own, filter by map criteria like zip code and school boundaries, and categorize your listings by favorite or dislike. You'll even have the opportunity to set preferences for a predictive fit for listings usings PropertyFit and learn about the buying or selling process with Planner.\n\n#### Standardized data, better listings\n\nOneKey® MLS believes the real estate industry works better for consumers when it works together to eliminate hurdles to finding homes. That’s why OneKey® MLS is a leading participant in the Real Estate Standards Organization (RESO), which sets standards for the quality and normalization of real estate data nationwide. Every consumer benefits because standardized listings are easier to find, sort, and compare — the functions everyone cares about most when trying to buy or rent a home.\n\n#### Did You Know?\n\n##### Areas served\n\n- Long Island: Suffolk and Nassau Counties\n- Hudson Valley: Westchester, Putnam, Orange, Rockland, Sullivan, Dutchess, and Ulster Counties\n- New York City: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Bronx Boroughs\n\n##### History\n\n- Formed in 2018 through the merger of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island and the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service\n- Owned by the Long Island Board of REALTORS® and the Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS®\n\n\n##### OneKey® MLS stats\n\n- 43,000 professionals \\| 4,300 real estate brokerage offices\n- 1M+ active, pending and historical listings\n- ~35,000 listings bought, sold, or rented each month\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [OneKeyMLS.com](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/onekeymls)\n- [OneHome™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/onehome)\n- [About OneKey® MLS](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/mission)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"ogDescription":"Sidekick, the innovative generative AI assistant designed to elevate the productivity of real estate professionals, has announced a strategic partnership with OneKey® MLS.

A short questionnaire identifies clients’ top preferences and features to establish their PropertyFit™, a special score that helps agents and clients assess the degree to which the listing meets their needs. Planner helps them learn about and track the buying or selling process.\n\n#### Focused and interactive\n\nStay central to the transaction by providing your clients with your branded portal. OneHome™ enables them to request a tour, estimate monthly costs, provide feedback, or favorite a property. Send customized search results to a client so they see listings you know are right for them. Enable them to compare homes in the portal, or pull market insights about a neighborhood. Attach your notes and insights to listings you suggest to clients and highlight your market expertise.\n\n#### Rich school data\n\nOneHome™ provides critical school ratings information that compares the scores of elementary, middle, high, and private schools to schools across the OneKey® MLS service area.\n\n#### Synchronized with Matrix™\n\nClient activity and feedback from OneHome™ is synchronized with Matrix™, so there’s only one place to go to manage the OneHome™ portal. You can see when clients logged into the portal, opened your emails, saved searches on OneHome, favorited or discarded listings, or created notes.\n\nAgent Portal - View Inside Your Client's OneHome™ Account - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Software Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCql2_kY5Fis6OJ-_TZwYoWw?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.onekeymls.com%2F)\n\nSoftware Tutorials\n\n10.8K subscribers\n\n[Agent Portal - View Inside Your Client's OneHome™ Account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSFdQsZrENs)\n\nSoftware Tutorials\n\nSearch\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

The condominium market held steady with no year-over-year change, posting a median sale price of $510,204. Co-ops saw a modest increase in value, with a median price of $299,000, up 3.1% compared to April 2024.\n\nWhile prices generally remained strong, sales activity declined across all housing types:\n\n- Single-family home sales fell by 4.9%.\n- Condominium sales dropped 8.4%.\n- Co-op sales decreased by 14.0%.\n\nIn April 2025, the OneKey® MLS regional area reflected a mix of conditions. While home prices remain elevated in many counties, closed sales activity and available inventory suggest a shift to a more cautious market. Single-family homes continue to drive price growth across the region, though affordability pressures appear to be tempering demand. In contrast, condo and co-op markets showed softer sales volume and more significant year-over-year volatility in pricing.\n\n“The data shows that while some areas are adjusting after rapid price gains, others are seeing buyers hesitate amid economic and interest rate uncertainty,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS. “These local variations reinforce the importance of understanding market dynamics at the local level—and overall, the resilience in pricing signals underlying strength in the region’s housing market.”\n\nTo access a complete list of detailed regional and county-based market reports, please visit[**https://marketstats.onekeymls.com**](https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/) [.](https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/) ﻿\n\n* * *\n\n**About OneKey® MLS**\n\nOneKey® MLS is New York’s largest multiple listing service, serving more than 45,000 licensed real estate professionals across Long Island, Manhattan, and the Hudson Valley.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

Good thing OneKey® MLS can help you take care of business.\n\n#### Meaningful collaboration starts with Matrix™\n\nOneKey® MLS's collaboration platform begins with Matrix™  where you can enable your clients to view property listings, save favorites, and set up alerts in a personalized portal branded with your logo and headshot. You can also auto-email property alerts based on specific criteria, such as location, price range, or property features. When a new listing that matches comes on the market, your client automatically gets an email. Clients can also set up a property search, so that you and your client can explore various options together, and work as a team to find the right property. Best of all, you can track what your clients like and don't like from within Matrix™, so you can respond with more targeted listings and proactively follow-up with alternatives that better fit their needs. And of course, Matrix™ is completely mobile, so you can work from anywhere, and add notes to listings your clients can see, or review their search history and preferences.\n\n#### Finding a fit in OneHome™\n\nCollaboration opportunities continue in OneHome™, the sleek consumer portal that is natively integrated with Matrix™. OneHome™ is available to all OneKey® MLS agents and brokers, though clients can participate by invitation only. Clients enjoy OneHome's personalized property recommendations made through the PropertyFit™ algorithm, which is based on their preferences, browsing history, and saved searches. The more a client interacts with PropertyFit™, the more tailored their recommendations become. It makes the search process more dynamic and personalized, so you can focus on more relevant properties. OneHome™ also provides detailed insights into your clients' activity, including which listings they view, save, or ignore so you can understand their preferences more clearly. An interactive tour planner enables clients to select homes they would like to see; you see the list, make comments, finalize appointments and send the schedule. It's highly efficient collaboration for everyone.\n\n#### Mobile collaboration in real-time with MLS-Touch®\n\nNothing beats real-time communication, and MLS-Touch® enables you to communicate directly within the app so you can send messages, share listings, and ask (and answer!) questions. You can also see which listings your clients view, save, or discard right within the app, so you can refine what you present to your clients no matter where you are. Because MLS-Touch® is an iOS and Android app, it can also send automatic push notifications to clients about price changes, status changes, or other alerts you deem important so you stay top of mind. And because the app is co-branded with your brand and contact information, it reinforces your brand and professionalism.\n\n#### Simplify the transaction\n\nOnce your clients have found their new home, the transaction begins ... and for many clients, that's the part that requires evenmoreof your time. Help your rental clients though the application process with RentSpree's streamlined and automated process, which only requires them to fill out one application that can be reused for many properties. RentSpree handles all aspects of the application process, including background and credit checks via Transunion. On OneKey® MLS, rentals eligible for RentSpree are noted in Matrix™. Help your home buyer clients understand what they can really afford early in their home search via RatePlug. Just connect RatePlug in Matrix to your listings and lenders, and start sharing the more detailed costs of homeownership. Transaction management is a snap when it comes time to managing the offer and closing in TransactionDesk, because all of the necessary forms are populated with the appropriate OneKey® MLS data, and a secure portal enables you to share documents 24x7x365 with your clients.\n\n### RentSpree Tenant Credit Report\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/client-collaboration)\n\n### TransactionDesk® Transaction Inventory\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/client-collaboration)\n\n### RatePlug Agent Dashboard\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/client-collaboration)\n\n### MLS-Touch® Add Clients\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/client-collaboration)\n\n### Matrix™ Client Favorites\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/client-collaboration)\n\n#### Did You Know?\n\n##### Collaboration throughout the transaction\n\n- Client collaboration tools sync between Matrix™and OneHome™\n- Anything clients can interact with is branded with your information\n- Helps you stay top of mind and reinforces your professionalism\n\n##### Easier transaction management\n\n- RatePlug is available on every sale listing in OneKey® MLS once you sign up\n- RentSpree is free for REALTORS®\n- TransactionDesk enables you to securely originate a transaction in a single click\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [MLS-Touch®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/mls-touch)\n- [OneHome™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/onehome)\n- [RatePlug](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/rateplug)\n- [RentSpree](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/rentspree)\n- [TransactionDesk®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/transaction-desk)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Explore Solution Support](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/client-collaboration)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

Condominiums saw a significant uptick, with a closed median sale price of $523,000, reflecting an increase of 10.3% from $474,000 the previous year. The closed median sale price for co-ops was $275,000, a 1.8% decrease from $280,000 in September 2023.\n\n![OneKey® MLS September 2024 Closed Transaction Volume](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKey-MLS-September-2024-Closed-Transaction-Pie-1920w.jpg)![OneKey® MLS September 2024 Transaction Volume](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKey-MLS-September-2024-Closed-Transaction-Pie-1920w.jpg)\n\nIn terms of transaction volumes, closed sales for single-family homes and condominiums were down from last year and co-ops were up slightly. There were 3,222 single-family closed transactions in September 2024, a 2% decrease from September 2023. Condominium closed sales were 537 and co-op sales were 547, a 4.1% year-over-year decline and 0.4% year-over-year increase, respectively.\n\n### Slower Pace of Transactions Due to Lack of Inventory\n\nRichard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, commented on the current market conditions, stating, “While we are encouraged by the recent downward trend in mortgage rates, the continued lack of inventory remains a significant challenge.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"title":"\n    \n    NY Regional Housing Market Continues Strong Performance into Fall\n  \n  ","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKey-MLS-September-2024-Median-Closed-Sales-5b5309e7-1920w.jpg","description":"Despite tight inventory, the median closed price for single family homes and condominiums rose year over year in September 2024, even though total transactions were down across the New York Metropolitan Region.","og:description":"Despite tight inventory, the median closed price for single family homes and condominiums rose year over year in September 2024, even though total transactions were down across the New York Metropolitan Region.","og:title":"NY Regional Housing Market Continues Strong Performance into Fall","ogDescription":"Despite tight inventory, the median closed price for single family homes and condominiums rose year over year in September 2024, even though total transactions were down across the New York Metropolitan Region.","article:published_time":"2024-10-21T17:36Z","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:type":"article","twitter:title":"NY Regional Housing Market Continues Strong Performance into Fall","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","language":"en","twitter:description":"Despite tight inventory, the median closed price for single family homes and condominiums rose year over year in September 2024, even though total transactions were down across the New York Metropolitan Region.","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKey-MLS-September-2024-Median-Closed-Sales-5b5309e7-1920w.jpg","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ny-regional-housing-market-continues-strong-performance-into-fall","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKey-MLS-September-2024-Median-Closed-Sales-5b5309e7-1920w.jpg","ogTitle":"NY Regional Housing Market Continues Strong Performance into Fall","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ny-regional-housing-market-continues-strong-performance-into-fall","scrapeId":"25c35897-32da-4711-a34f-8697d798c8db","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ny-regional-housing-market-continues-strong-performance-into-fall","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ny-regional-housing-market-continues-strong-performance-into-fall","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","Market Report","Housing Market","Statistics"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2024-report","title":"NY Regional Housing Market Continues Strong Performance into Fall","description":"OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for September 2024 reflecting continued strength in the housing market with higher-value transactions.

Condominiums reported a closed median sale price of $503,000, reflecting a 3.7% increase from the same price reported a year ago. The closed median sale price for co-ops was $280,000, a 3.4% decrease from $290,000 in December 2023.\n\nIn terms of transactional activity, closed sales for single-family homes and condominiums were up compared to last year while co-ops were down. There were 3,256 single-family closed transactions in December 2024, an 11.1% increase from December 2023. Condominium closed sales were 559 and co-op sales were 494, marking a 12.2% year-over-year increase and 15.6% decline respectively.\n\nRichard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, commented on the current market conditions, stating, “The continued limited inventory in our region remains a key driver of price stability and increases, particularly in the single-family and condominium markets. Buyers are still actively pursuing homeownership despite higher interest rates, and the competition for limited available properties is keeping prices elevated.”\n\nHaggerty further noted, “The increase in closed sales for single-family homes and condos suggests that demand remains strong, even as affordability challenges persist. However, the decline in co-op sales reflects some market hesitancy in that segment, possibly due to financing constraints or shifting buyer preferences.”\n\nOneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from the counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:type":"article","ogDescription":"OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for December 2024 reflecting continued strength in the housing market with higher-value transactions.","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Graphs--miniature-homes--magnifying-glass-1920w-1920w.webp","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Graphs--miniature-homes--magnifying-glass-1920w-1920w.webp","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Graphs--miniature-homes--magnifying-glass-1920w-1920w.webp","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","twitter:title":"Limited Inventory Continues to Drive Home Prices Higher Across the Region","title":"\n    \n    Limited Inventory Continues to Drive Home Prices Higher Across the Region\n  \n  ","language":"en","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","og:description":"OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for December 2024 reflecting continued strength in the housing market with higher-value transactions.","twitter:description":"OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for December 2024 reflecting continued strength in the housing market with higher-value transactions.","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/limited-inventory-continues-to-drive-home-prices-higher-across-the-region","og:title":"Limited Inventory Continues to Drive Home Prices Higher Across the Region","description":"OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for December 2024 reflecting continued strength in the housing market with higher-value transactions.","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/limited-inventory-continues-to-drive-home-prices-higher-across-the-region","ogTitle":"Limited Inventory Continues to Drive Home Prices Higher Across the Region","article:published_time":"2025-02-04T22:34Z","scrapeId":"c30b0f4a-79ec-4bbe-999d-50fd5029da02","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/limited-inventory-continues-to-drive-home-prices-higher-across-the-region","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/limited-inventory-continues-to-drive-home-prices-higher-across-the-region","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","Market Report","Housing Market","Statistics","MLS"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025-report","title":"Limited Inventory Continues to Drive Home Prices Higher Across the Region","description":"OneKey® MLS, the premier real estate marketplace providing monthly statistics for residential transactions from Montauk to Manhattan and through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, reported data for December 2024 reflecting continued strength in the housing market with higher-value transactions.

From straightforward listing entry to streamlined showing services designed to take the guesswork out of scheduling, getting your property to market and close is as easy as 1-2-3\n\n[Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660238626196-Listing-Showing)\n\n### List, market, show, and close your listing with with integrated tools.\n\n#### Simple Add/Edit\n\nOneKey® MLS is built on the CoreLogic® Matrix™ platform, which features a can’t-miss, step-by-step add/edit module that enables you to upload a new listing with high resolution photos and virtual tours in a matter of minutes. Draw extra attention and ongoing engagement to your listing with a floor plan from CubiCasa. You can also update a listing from anywhere using MLS-Touch®, or within Matrix™ itself on any device. Pull in comprehensive tax data about your listing from Realist®, all at the touch of a button.\n\n#### Schedule showings\n\nTake the headache of scheduling showings away with ShowingTime™ for the MLS by setting your preferences as the listing agent when you upload your listing. If you’re a buyer’s agent, you can create a cart for a client to handle multiple showings and even put the addresses in a logical order with drive times. Or use MLS-Touch® to manage showing requests from anywhere. Let clients in via SentriLock's Near Field Technology, even if your cellular network is down.\n\n#### Screen tenants\n\nUse RentSpree to automatically screen prospective tenants right within your listing. RentSpree is automatically included on thousands of rental listings on OneKeyMLS.com — presenting you with automatic opportunities to close more rentals every time your listing goes to market.\n\n#### Help with down payments\n\nBroaden exposure for your listing by letting your clients know about their eligibility for down payment assistance through Down Payment Resource. Every eligible listing on OneKeyMLS.com automatically bears the DPR icon so it’s instantly recognizable, and 79 percent of homes qualify.  Down payment assistance can be used for single family homes, multi-family, and condominiums, and programs offer up to $200,000 of assistance.\n\n### Matrix™ Listings Manager\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/listing-showing)\n\n### CubiCasa Floor Plan\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/listing-showing)\n\n### MLS-Touch® Mobile App\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/listing-showing)\n\n### SentriLock® Open Home Schedule\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/listing-showing)\n\n### ShowingTime™ for MLS Calendar\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/listing-showing)\n\n### RentSpree Applicant Dossier\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/listing-showing)\n\n### OneKeyMLS.com DPR Eligible Listing\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/listing-showing)\n\nView more\n\n#### Did You Know?\n\n##### Great listings, great data\n\n- Every listing is backed up with sales history, property characteristics, public records data and neighborhood data within Matrix™ and Realist®\n- RESO Standard data makes it easy to find, compare, and market listings\n\n\n##### Built-in collaboration\n\n- Collaborate seamlessly with clients across applications; start in Matrix™, schedule showings in ShowingTime™ for the MLS, edit in MLS-Touch® in the field\n- Interact with and track client preferences within the OneHome™ Portal\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [CubiCasa](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cubicasa)\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [MLS-Touch®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/mls-touch)\n- [Down Payment Resource](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/down-payment-resource)\n- [RentSpree](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/rentspree)\n- [SentriLock®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n- [ShowingTime™ for the MLS](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660238626196-Listing-Showing)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"title":"\n    \n    Richard Haggerty Named 2024 Long Island Business  Influencer\n  \n  ","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/richard-haggerty-named-2024-long-island-business-influencer","ogTitle":"Richard Haggerty Named 2024 Long Island Business  Influencer","og:type":"article","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/LIBN-Influencer-Richard-Haggerty-b91e40d6-1920w.png","language":"en","article:published_time":"2024-08-16T21:54Z","og:title":"Richard Haggerty Named 2024 Long Island Business  Influencer","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/richard-haggerty-named-2024-long-island-business-influencer","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/LIBN-Influencer-Richard-Haggerty-b91e40d6-1920w.png","og:description":"Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, was named to the 2024 Long Island Business News Real Estate Influencer List for his positive impact in the community.","ogDescription":"Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, was named to the 2024 Long Island Business News Real Estate Influencer List for his positive impact in the community.","twitter:description":"Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, was named to the 2024 Long Island Business News Real Estate Influencer List for his positive impact in the community.","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","twitter:title":"Richard Haggerty Named 2024 Long Island Business  Influencer","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/LIBN-Influencer-Richard-Haggerty-b91e40d6-1920w.png","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","description":"Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, was named to the 2024 Long Island Business News Real Estate Influencer List for his positive impact in the community.","scrapeId":"75d2c010-936c-40b8-a7b4-213228aa8e2d","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/richard-haggerty-named-2024-long-island-business-influencer","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/richard-haggerty-named-2024-long-island-business-influencer","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","News","Business","Community"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2024-influencer","title":"Richard Haggerty Named 2024 Long Island Business Real Estate Influencer","description":"Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, was named to the Long Island Business News Influencers: Real Estate & Construction 2024 list.

Condominiums saw a modest rise, with a closed median sale price of $500,000 compared to $499,000 last year. Meanwhile, the closed median sale price for co-ops remained steady at $295,000, unchanged from November 2023.\n\nIn terms of transactional activity, there were fewer closed sales for single-family homes, condominiums, and co-op compared to last year. There were 2,864 single-family closed transactions in November 2024, representing a 1% decrease from November 2023. Condominium closed sales were 476 and co-op sales were 490, a 15% and 21% year-over-year decline, respectively.\n\nOneKey® MLS CEO Richard Haggerty, commented on the current market conditions, stating, “The November housing market demonstrates a mix of resilience and adjustment. Healthy year-over-year growth in single-family home prices, a modest uptick in condominium prices, and stable co-op values highlight a market that remains steady despite shifting economic conditions. While the decline in transactional activity across all property types reflects broader economic factors and seasonal trends, it also underscores the ongoing demand for diverse housing options in our region.”\n\nOneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from the counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey®

Despite tighter inventory in some areas, the market has remained resilient, demonstrating continued buyer demand and strong seller confidence. Condominiums saw a slight dip in median price by 5.3% to $539,660, while co-op prices remained steady at around $299,000.\n\nRichard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, noted, “While we’re seeing subtle changes across property types, the broader market reflects solid stability. Buyers are adjusting to current interest rates, and sellers are responding by bringing more listings to the market. This spring has been characterized by motivated buyers and well-priced homes moving quickly, especially single-family properties that continue to attract competitive offers.”\n\nNew listings for single-family homes increased by 3.8% compared to last May, with 5,801 homes hitting the market in May alone. Condos and co-ops also saw new listings rise by 6.5% and 3.4% respectively, providing more options for buyers navigating a historically tight housing market.\n\nAs summer approaches, OneKey® MLS expects market activity to remain brisk, driven by sustained buyer interest and a gradual improvement in available inventory.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers.

Assuring that everyone has the same access to information about listings and opportunities to view properties is essential. Take action and supportFair Housing Forwardby:\n\nAn Overview of the Fair Housing Act - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of National Association of REALTORS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHkeJOyp0Pb3dJSt4iXjPQA?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.onekeymls.com%2F)\n\nNational Association of REALTORS\n\n29.4K subscribers\n\n[An Overview of the Fair Housing Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94TVHAJtang)\n\nNational Association of REALTORS\n\nSearch\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

The[National Fair Housing Act of 1968](http://www.hud.gov/)prohibits discrimination concerning the sale, rental, financing, and advertising of housing based on race, religion, national origin, sex (and as amended), handicap, and family status. It recognizes that property rights should not be abridged and upholds access to housing of choice. State and local laws also prohibit discrimination, often on a broader set of criteria, including discrimination based upon sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and source of lawful income. Learn more about New York state’s fair housing policy on the[New York State Association of REALTORS' site](https://www.nysar.com/fair-housing/). NAR’s Fair housing policy opposes discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and national origin. And though strides forward have been made, the fight is not over. NAR reported as of 2018 that only half the country prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and that HUD noted that the highest proportion of complaints was discrimination based on disability. OneKey® MLS subscribers must comply with applicable fair housing laws and regulations, including those at the state and local level. Your everyday actions have a significant impact on protecting housing rights in America -- upholding access to housing of choice in treating everyone the same, encouraging a fair and open housing marketplace.\n\n- **Ensuring you know and abide by the requirement to submit listings and NAR's Clear Cooperation**. As a OneKey® MLS subscriber, you agree to abide by NAR’s Clear Cooperation policy. Listing agents must enter all listings within the OneKey® MLS footprint within one (1) business day of marketing to the public. If instructed by your seller not to market in the MLS, you must fill out an Office Exclusive Form and have it signed by your seller. The listing is entered in the MLS asPrivate - Y.Learn more about the[Clear Cooperation](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/updates)and the recently announcedMultiple Listing Options for Sellers.\n\n- **Setting and maintaining accurate and up-to-date statuses for your listing.**Do you know your status definitions? Test your knowledge in the callout box at the bottom of this article. It’s a great time to review the status definition and ensure that you are updating your listings promptly. That assures every buyer (and their agent) the same opportunity to access your listing. Learn more about listing statuses in the[Knowledge Base](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/32884719424788-Status-Definitions-Days-on-Market-DOM-and-Cumulative-Days-on-Market-CDOM-Impact).\n\n![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Legacy+Title-1920w.jpg)\n\n- **Considering accessibility in your listings and showings and fill out all the appropriate listing fields**. NAR calls this issue of accessibility: Visitable Housing. Take into consideration how individuals with mobility or sensory challenges may be impacted. Among questions to consider are: Is there wheelchair accessibility? Are all age groups likely to be as comfortable accessing the listing? What type of latches are available on doors? Are there threshold height differences between types of flooring? Consider heights for countertops and how things like sinks and faucets are positioned can have a potential impact. Try to anticipate possible challenges clients may face living in the home and hosting others and disclose this information to make for a better experience for all. You can find these fields to consider on your[listing forms](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/31864456106388-Listing-Forms)and in ADD/EDIT in Matrix.\n\n- **Including Photo Type and Photo Description in your listings**to improve their reach. Adding the caption or type to your listing photos and a description especially assists viewers who may use a visual accessibility screen reader.\n\n### Fields to Consider for Accessibility\n\n![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-6249432-1920w.jpeg)\n\n- Levels in Unit/Home\n- Room Type / Room Level\n- Interior Features: 1st Floor Bedroom, 1st Floor Full Bath\n- Accessibility Features: Accessible Approach with Ramp, Accessible Bedroom, Accessible Central Living Area, Accessible Closets, Accessible Doors, Accessible Elevator Installed, Accessible Entrance, Accessible for Hearing-Impairment, Accessible Full Bath, Accessible Hallway(s), Accessible Kitchen, Accessible Kitchen Appliances, Accessible Stairway, Accessible Bathroom Walls, Adaptable For Elevator, Customized Wheelchair Accessible, Grip-Accessible Features, Smart Technology, Stair Lift, Therapeutic Whirlpool, Visitor Bathroom\n- Parking Features\n- Remarks\n- Showing Description\n- Senior Housing Community\n- Association Amenities\n- Photo Type and Description\n\n- **Using inclusive language in your listing remarks and ensure that you describe the property, not neighborhoods or people.** Consider how your language aligns with Fair Housing guidelines and that you accurately and inclusively represent the property. Remember that the[law](https://www.nyc.gov/site/fairhousing/rights-responsibilities/real-estate-advertisements.page#:~:text=The%20law%20prohibits%20the%20making,to%20features%20of%20the%20property)prohibits directly or indirectly stating a preference or limitation based on any protected classes.\n\n- **Utilizing photos in your listing that depict property.**Just as the descriptions in public remarks for your listing should contain only information pertinent to the property, not people, your photos should also be property-centric. Though you may choose to show people, remember that these images may create concerns about fair housing, inadvertently showing the ideal resident of a particular house, property, or neighborhood. They also create the potential for use of likeness complaints for the listing agent. Photos that contain multiple individuals of ONLY one race/class are of particular concern.\n\n- **Calling out discrimination when you see it.**We all understand that mistakes happen when entering or updating a listing or sale, but we also have a responsibility to uphold the law and act in support of fair housing. Please report questionable listings toCompliance@OneKeyMLS.com. Your report is confidential, and the Compliance team will follow up on each report.\n\n- **Boosting transparency about layout by including floorplans**with your listings. Your OneKey MLS subscription includes floor plans through[CubiCasa](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/cubicasa), an easy and accessible way to add information to your listing.\n\n- **Highlighting down payment assistance programs**and affordability options to make home ownership as accessible as possible with[Down Payment Resource](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/), included with your OneKey MLS subscription.\n\nTest Your Knowledge Answer Key:\n\n1. False, Coming Soon listings are not available for showings.\n2. True\n3.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"ogTitle":"Small Moments, Big Impact","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg","viewport":["initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","width=device-width, initial-scale=1"],"twitter:card":"summary_large_image","description":"OneKey® MLS is the 10th largest MLS in the United States.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

Individual property types saw varying degrees of appreciation, with single-family homes up 9.4%, condominiums rising 6.3%, and co-ops increasing slightly by 0.7%.\n\nDespite higher home prices, 48,857 closed sales transactions were recorded in 2024, representing a 2.5% decrease compared to the previous year. The highest number of closed sales occurred in Suffolk County with 12,913, followed by Nassau County with 9,748, and Westchester County with 7,127.\n\nOne of the most significant market challenges remained low inventory. The number of available homes for sale fell by 6.8% to 13,091, continuing a trend that has constrained buyer options. However, pending sales increased by 1.5% to 51,060, indicating a steady level of buyer demand heading into 2025.\n\nRichard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, provided an analysis of the 2024 market conditions: “The 2024 housing market was defined by rising prices and tight inventory, which continued to challenge affordability and limit choices for buyers. While total closed sales declined slightly, strong buyer demand kept home prices moving upward across all property types. With pending sales showing a slight uptick and economists predicting a more active housing market in 2025, we expect to see a more balanced environment as conditions gradually improve for buyers and sellers alike.\"\n\nAs the largest multiple listing service in New York, OneKey® MLS provides comprehensive market data that reflects the full scope of its subscribers’ service areas, extending beyond its defined geographic footprint.\n\nFor more information and detailed market insights, visit[**https://marketstats.onekeymls.com**](https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/).\n\n**About OneKey® MLS**\n\nOneKey® MLS is one of the nation's leading Multiple Listing Services, serving tens of thousands of real estate professionals across Long Island, New York City, and the Hudson Valley.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers.

The closed median sale price for the region reached $637,500, reflecting a 9.5% increase over 2023. Individual property types saw varying degrees of appreciation, with single-family homes up 9.4%, condominiums rising 6.3%, and co-ops increasing slightly by 0.7%. Despite higher home prices, 48,857 closed sales transactions were recorded in 2024, representing a 2.5% decrease compared to the previous year. The highest number of closed sales occurred in Suffolk County with 12,913, followed by Nassau County with 9,748, and Westchester County with 7,127. One of the most significant market challenges remained low inventory. The number of available homes for sale fell by 6.8% to 13,091, continuing a trend that has constrained buyer options. However, pending sales increased by 1.5% to 51,060, indicating a steady level of buyer demand heading into 2025.","price":"N/A","category":"Real Estate Market

Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Matrix Supplement Types](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Doc+Privacy-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/coming-soon-matrix-document-privacy-options)\n\n### [Release Notes: March 12, 2025](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/coming-soon-matrix-document-privacy-options)\n\nBy Gabrielle Medina•March 7, 2025\n\nMatrix Document Privacy Options\n\n[![RE-Target from Savvy Card Logo](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Re-Target-1920x1020-thumb-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-signs-with-re-target)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS signs with RE-Target to deliver targeted MLS dashboard advertising and communications](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-signs-with-re-target)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•October 27, 2024\n\nOneKey® MLS selected RE-Target® by SavvyCard® to deliver targeted advertising and communications via its Clareity MLS SSO dashboard.\n\n[![Sidekick Logo](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Sidekick_Logo-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/sidekick-and-onekey-mls-announce-partnership)\n\n### [Sidekick and OneKey® MLS Announce Partnership](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/sidekick-and-onekey-mls-announce-partnership)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 22, 2024\n\nSidekick, the innovative generative AI assistant designed to elevate the productivity of real estate professionals, has announced a strategic partnership with OneKey® MLS.

But OneKey® MLS—serving the Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS® and the Long Island Board of REALTORS®—has taken a different path that offers other MLS operators some good fodder for long term strategic thinking.\n\nOneKey transitioned to a single MLS platform. WAV Group sat down with OneKey CEO Richard Haggerty to talk about the strategic thinking behind this shift.\n\n“For many reasons, OneKey MLS felt it was in our members’ best interest to have a unified front- and back-end solution,” Haggerty said. “This wasn’t just a technical upgrade. It was a foundational shift—one that touched every part of our system and, more importantly, impacted the professionals who depend on us every day. Substantial progress often comes wrapped in inconvenience, but we took this step because we believe in building an MLS that isn’t just functional, but future ready. We didn’t make this move just to fix problems—we made it to create room for what’s next: smarter tools, deeper insights, and better collaboration with our industry partners. You can’t build that on a foundation split in two.”\n\n## Being Future Ready\n\nHaving a unified (think single) backend database is a keynote to being future ready. With this move, OneKey transformed their data schema to the RESO standards. This is such an important choice. At the surface level, listing input matches listing output – like what you would display on an agent website, flyer, CMA, etc. On a technical level, every application that connects to the MLS – albeit an MLS application offering, a data share, or any technology vendor that may be authorized by a participant can have confidence in the data mapping as a result of RESO standardization.\n\nFrom its inception, OneKey MLS was designed to align with how brokers and agents do business across the region. Formed just a week before the COVID-19 shutdown, the MLS prioritized minimizing disruption. The best path at that time was to mirror data across two legacy systems – and two legacy data schema – avoiding the complexity of training agents on a new interface during a period of intense uncertainty. While significant field adjustments were made to unify the data model, the underlying structure still required extensive translation to maintain and synchronize fields and lookups between platforms.\n\n“At the time, reducing disruption for agents was the right call,” Haggerty explained. “Our goal was to solve a data problem for our members. OneKey shouldered the heavy lift and expense of managing both systems behind the scenes so agents wouldn’t feel the strain. That approach solved the ‘overlapping market disorder’ that had long challenged brokers and agents and paved the way for the successful merger of two adjacent markets”.\n\nOperating two parallel systems meant OneKey had to duplicate efforts across data management, training, compliance, and support. “Each platform had its strengths,” said Haggerty. “We shared data in real time to create as seamless an experience as possible. But even the best handshake between systems isn’t the same as a sole source of truth. As the market evolved and expectations around speed, accuracy, and flexibility grew, we realized that what once served us well was now holding us back. So, we did the challenging thing—we unified.”\n\n### OneKey MLS unified its backend on Matrix to streamline operations, boost data accuracy, and deliver smarter, future-ready tools for real estate professionals across NY.\n\nIn 2024, nearly five years after its founding, OneKey consolidated all users onto[Cotality’s Matrix](https://www.cotality.com/products/matrix)platform.\n\nUnder a single MLS system, OneKey has built a strong, future-ready foundation. Today, the organization is focused on delivering a curated set of solutions—what Haggerty calls a “solution-based strategy” rather than a product-centric one. The idea of adopting a product just to see if it sticks is inefficient and often ineffective,” Haggerty said. “Everyone wants the next shiny toy, but we have to ask: will this actually solve a pain point for our members?”\n\nWith Matrix, OneKey is focused on operationalizing one system, relieving the complexity of data management, system integration, and support for the MLS staff. Haggerty reports that the organization is nimbler today and has heightened its ability to deliver solutions more seamlessly.\n\n## New OneKey Strategic Solutions\n\n### Knowledge Base:\n\nTo better support subscribers, OneKey launched a digital Knowledge Base—a self-service tool akin to an FAQ or Wiki. The goal is to empower members to find answers quickly and reduce call center volume. More importantly, Haggerty notes, “we want every inbound call to feel like a private micro-training – something personalized and goal-focused.”\n\nThe next step for OneKey is to launch an AI-driven support center trained on the Knowledge Base content. The vision is a 24/7 support agent that can assist users in any language, continuing OneKey’s commitment to serving a diverse subscriber base for a wide range of common support needs.\n\n### Ocusell Listing Management:\n\nOneKey also partnered with Ocusell to support brokerages managing listings in multiple MLS systems. OneKey provides MLS services surrounding New York City and Long Island, and soon firms in the Borough of Manhattan will be able to publish listings directly into Matrix via Ocusell, streamlining the process and reducing duplication of effort.\n\n## Front-End Choice vs. Single MLS System\n\nWhile multiple front ends can help remove barriers for markets to merge, it is not an inexpensive proposition. The cost of normalizing the data and keeping it synchronized in real time requires specialized data management personnel and data transport costs. Making changes to the systems also demands skillful management. If one field is changed, it needs to be changed twice, and coordinated perfectly with multiple vendors.\n\nIf the strategy is important, the effort is worth it. For OneKey MLS, the front end of choice option was a catalyst to merge MLSs. Today, having converted to a single system, OneKey has streamlined operations, and liberated resources for providing other solutions to better serve their customers.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the door is closed on future options. “We’re not opposed to offering alternative front ends if there’s a compelling reason that better serves the needs of our customers,” said Haggerty. “But simply offering choice for choice’s sake has limited benefits and many challenges. The leadership at OneKey is committed to delivering the tools and solutions that help our customers succeed. Every decision is made with intention—and with our subscribers’ success in mind.”\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York.

Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all. Assuring that everyone has the same access to information about listings and opportunities to view properties is essential.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

The SentriKey® App allows easy access and tracking.\n\n**PREMIUM PRODUCT**\n\n[TO ACTIVATE YOUR SENTRILOCK® SUBSCRIPTION PLEASE](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/) [**CLICK HERE**](https://lockbox.onekeymls.com/) [AND ENTER YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD.](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n[SentriLock® Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27445062574740-SentriLock-Resources)\n\n## Premium: Easy and secure entry, whether you’re there or not.\n\n#### Flexible and mobile\n\nSentriKey® real estate app and software system helps manage lockbox access, showings, and client experiences.\n\n#### Reliable without cellular service\n\nSentriLock’s mission is simple: 100% access, 100% of the time. That means giving REALTORS® the gold standard: A lockbox that works with cell service, or even more important, without it. SentriLock’s lockboxes can be opened via Bluetooth™ or Near Field Technology (NFT), or with a code on a keypad. This is especially important for properties in remote or rural areas with poor cellular coverage.\n\n#### Durable, long-lasting, and secure\n\nMade with hardened steel, SentriLock’s SentriGuard® lockboxes are resistant to corrosion, prying, drills, and even bolt cutters. The primary battery is replaceable and lasts 10 years to maximize functionality and minimize maintenance. The built-in backup battery guards against complete power failure. There is even an extra large key bin for the assortment of keys that come with today’s properties.\n\n#### Safety first\n\nEvery SentriLock® lockbox is designed to notify agents and clients when it’s opened and closed, signifying when a property is entered and exited. Through the SentriKey® app, alerts can also be sent to emergency contacts when an agent’s safety is threatened.\n\n### SentriLock® Applications and Lock Box\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n\n### SentriConnect from SentriLock®\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n\n### SentriLock® Lockbox Inventory\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n\n### SentriLock® Schedule\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n\n### SentriLock® Access Schedule\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n\n### SentriLock® Listings\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n\n#### Popular Features\n\n##### Robust mobile app\n\n- Manage and operate lockbox from phone\n- Generate access codes\n- Schedule access to prevent crossover appointments\n\n\n##### Convenient and easy\n\n- Unlocks with Bluetooth® or NFT\n- Integrates with ShowingTime™, Matrix™, and RPR®\n- U.S.-based customer support team\n\n\n##### Keep everyone informed\n\n- Notify clients when lockboxes are opened/closed\n- Activate emergency alerts when necessary\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [ShowingTime™ for the MLS](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [MLS-Touch®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/mls-touch)\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [SentriLock® Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27445062574740-SentriLock-Resources)\n- [Explore t](https://lockbox.onekeymls.com/) he Lockbox Store\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/RISMedia-Newsmakers-2025-1920w.jpg","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/RISMedia-Newsmakers-2025-1920w.jpg","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","twitter:title":"RISMedia Names Haggerty and King to 2025 Newsmakers List","article:published_time":"2025-02-03T15:10Z","og:title":"RISMedia Names Haggerty and King to 2025 Newsmakers List","ogTitle":"RISMedia Names Haggerty and King to 2025 Newsmakers List","language":"en","title":"\n    \n    RISMedia Names Haggerty and King to 2025 Newsmakers List\n  \n  ","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","og:type":"article","description":"RISMedia named Richard Haggerty and Melissa King to its coveted 2025 Newsmaker List, in recognition of their leadership and contributions to the MLS industry.","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/rismedia-names-haggerty-and-king-2025-newsmakers","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/RISMedia-Newsmakers-2025-1920w.jpg","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","twitter:description":"RISMedia named Richard Haggerty and Melissa King to its coveted 2025 Newsmaker List, in recognition of their leadership and contributions to the MLS industry.","og:description":"RISMedia named Richard Haggerty and Melissa King to its coveted 2025 Newsmaker List, in recognition of their leadership and contributions to the MLS industry.","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/rismedia-names-haggerty-and-king-2025-newsmakers","ogDescription":"RISMedia named Richard Haggerty and Melissa King to its coveted 2025 Newsmaker List, in recognition of their leadership and contributions to the MLS industry.","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","scrapeId":"c70a46d8-10f0-484a-8696-368c13dfe935","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/rismedia-names-haggerty-and-king-2025-newsmakers","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/rismedia-names-haggerty-and-king-2025-newsmakers","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","Housing","Market Insights","Support"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025","title":"OneKey® MLS","description":"OneKey® MLS is the largest multiple listing service in New York, providing a range of solutions for real estate professionals, including branding, marketing, client collaboration, lead generation, and more.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Driven by a vision of a multiple listing system (MLS) that works smarter, faster, and better for real estate professionals on both sides of the keyboard, their clients, and consumers. What does that look like? It starts with a suite of solutions that combine to create options and opportunities that equitably allow all passionate professionals the chance to thrive. Built on a foundation of impeccable data, structured with an emphasis on agile and iterative process and intuitive use, and delivered with empathy and acumen, the key to success is turning at OneKey® with this capable Chief Operations Officer on watch. With one eye on what’s to come with prominent industry insights afforded in her work co-chairing the Council of Multiple Listing Systems (CMLS) Best Practices Advisory Council (and past roles on the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Presidential Advisory Group (PAG) and committees), with the Real Estate Standards Organization (RESO), and as a resource consulting with other MLSs. And the other eye fully engaged on the day-to-day details of operations that deliver world-class solutions to more than 43,000 real estate professionals in the greater Metropolitan New York area.

Condominiums reported a closed median sale price of $500,000, reflecting no change from the same price reported a year ago. The closed median sale price for co-ops was $285,000, a 1.7% decrease from $290,000 in October 2023.\n\nIn terms of transactional activity, closed sales for single-family homes were up compared to last year while condominiums and co-ops were down. There were 3,335 single-family closed transactions in October 2024, a 3% increase from October 2023. Condominium closed sales were 528 and co-op sales were 545, a 4.9% and 22.8% year-over-year decline respectively.\n\nRichard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, commented on the current market conditions, stating, “Overall, the year-over-year gains in single-family home prices and the modest rise in closed transactions reinforce that the region’s real estate market remains robust, supported by continued buyer interest and competitive demand. Looking forward, we anticipate that while monthly variances may continue, the broader trend of gradual annual growth will persist, backed by strong market fundamentals.”\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from the counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKeyMLS-October-2024-Closed-Median-Prices-1920w.jpg","twitter:description":"OneKey® MLS reports that higher-value transactions show continued strength in October 2024, with the regional single-family closed median sale price was $706,000, marking an 8.6% year-over-year increase from $650,000 in October 2023 in the New York metropolitan residential real estate market.","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKeyMLS-October-2024-Closed-Median-Prices-1920w.jpg","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/steady-yearly-increase-in-home-prices-with-a-monthly-cooldown","twitter:title":"Steady Yearly Increase in Home Prices, With a Monthly Cooldown","ogTitle":"Steady Yearly Increase in Home Prices, With a Monthly Cooldown","language":"en","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","og:title":"Steady Yearly Increase in Home Prices, With a Monthly Cooldown","title":"\n    \n    Steady Yearly Increase in Home Prices, With a Monthly Cooldown\n  \n  ","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/steady-yearly-increase-in-home-prices-with-a-monthly-cooldown","article:published_time":"2024-11-19T19:12Z","description":"OneKey® MLS reports that higher-value transactions show continued strength in October 2024, with the regional single-family closed median sale price was $706,000, marking an 8.6% year-over-year increase from $650,000 in October 2023 in the New York metropolitan residential real estate market.","og:description":"OneKey® MLS reports that higher-value transactions show continued strength in October 2024, with the regional single-family closed median sale price was $706,000, marking an 8.6% year-over-year increase from $650,000 in October 2023 in the New York metropolitan residential real estate market.","ogDescription":"OneKey® MLS reports that higher-value transactions show continued strength in October 2024, with the regional single-family closed median sale price was $706,000, marking an 8.6% year-over-year increase from $650,000 in October 2023 in the New York metropolitan residential real estate market.","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","og:type":"article","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKeyMLS-October-2024-Closed-Median-Prices-1920w.jpg","scrapeId":"746a1a63-15cd-49ff-b71b-43fd5b83822d","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/steady-yearly-increase-in-home-prices-with-a-monthly-cooldown","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/steady-yearly-increase-in-home-prices-with-a-monthly-cooldown","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","Market Report","Housing Market","Statistics"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2024-report","title":"Steady Yearly Increase in Home Prices, With a Monthly Cooldown","description":"Single-Family Home Price Rises 8.6% Year-Over-Year to $706,000 in October 2024, Slightly Down from $715,000 Last Month.

Touch device users can use touch and swipe gestures.\n\n# ADA Compliance Statement\n\n## Accessibility Policy\n\nOneKey® MLS is committed to providing an accessible website. If you have difficulty accessing content, have difficulty viewing a file on the website, or notice any accessibility problems, please contact OneKey® MLS at [support@onekeymls.com](mailto:support@onekeymls.com) to specify the nature of the accessibility issue and any assistive technology you use. OneKey® MLS will strive to provide the content you need in the format you require.\n\n#### Our Commitment to Accessibility\n\nWe are continually working to improve the accessibility of our Site to ensure it is usable by individuals with disabilities. Our goal is to comply with applicable accessibility laws and guidelines, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which provide recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities.\n\n#### Third-Party Content\n\nWhile we strive to ensure the accessibility of our Site, some content may be provided by third parties. We cannot guarantee the accessibility of third-party websites or services linked to or embedded in our Site. However, we encourage third-party providers to comply with accessibility standards and recommend users reach out to them directly with any concerns.\n\n#### Ongoing Accessibility Enhancements\n\nWe are committed to continuous improvement of our Site's accessibility. Our goal is to keep our Site up to date with evolving accessibility standards and to provide an inclusive digital experience for all users, regardless of ability.\n\n#### Web Accessibility Help\n\n##### I am visually impaired.\n\nIf you have trouble seeing web pages, the [US Social Security Administration offers these tips](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/index.html) for optimizing your computer and browser to improve your online experience.\n\n- Use your computer to read web pages out loud\n- Use the keyboard to navigate screens\n- Increase text size\n- Magnify your screen\n- Change background and text colors\n- Make your mouse pointer more visible\n\n##### I find a keyboard or mouse hard to use.\n\nIf you find a keyboard or mouse difficult to use, speech recognition software is available that may help you navigate web pages and online services. This software allows you to move focus around a web page or application screen through voice controls.\n\n##### I am deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nIf you are deaf or hard of hearing, there are several accessibility features available to you.\n\n#### Transcripts\n\nA text transcript is a text equivalent of audio information that includes spoken words and non-spoken sounds such as sound effects. OneKey® MLS is reviewing adding transcripts to scripted video and audio content.\n\n#### Captioning\n\nA caption is a transcript for the audio track of a video presentation that is synchronized with the video and audio tracks. Captions are generally rendered visually by being superimposed over the video, which benefits people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, and anyone who cannot hear the audio (e.g., when in a crowded room). The videos linked on our OneKey® MLS websites to YouTube and Vimeo have captions readily available. [Learn how to turn captioning on and off in YouTube.](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/100078?hl=en)\n\n#### Volume Controls\n\nYour computer, tablet, or mobile device has volume control features. Each video and audio service has its own additional volume controls. Try adjusting both your device’s volume controls and your media players’ volume controls to optimize your listening experience.\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","title":"\n    \n    ADA Compliance Statement | OneKey® MLS\n  \n  ","description":"OneKey® MLS is committed to providing an accessible website.

Sunil's passion for aligning change with organizational vision sets him apart. Sunil has built a reputation by transforming business operations through technology. But innovation isn’t just about technology—it’s about executing the right changes that drive success. By focusing on strategic execution, he has a track record of ensuring that companies adapt and thrive, helping them reach their goals and stay ahead in an evolving industry.\n\nHis real estate industry experience began 10 years ago as a system and network engineer before transitioning into software development, where he has since combined technical expertise with strategic vision to create meaningful change.

Leading development teams, Sunil has fostered a culture of collaboration, accountability, and growth.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/sunil-anthony-welcomed","language":"en","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:title":"Sunil Anthony  Welcomed as Director of Innovation","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/sunil-anthony-welcomed","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/SunilAnthony-793f489b-1920w.jpg","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","title":"\n    \n    Sunil Anthony  Welcomed as Director of Innovation\n  \n  ","og:type":"article","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","twitter:title":"Sunil Anthony  Welcomed as Director of Innovation","description":"OneKey® MLS is the 10th largest MLS in the United States.

The partnership with OneKey MLS underscores CubiCasa’s steadfast commitment to making digital floor plans a standard feature in U.S. home listings and OneKey MLS’s commitment to providing innovative solutions to its subscribers.\n\n“Our collaboration with CubiCasa is significant as it will help us provide added value by bringing more floor plans to listings in our market,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Equipping our members with easy-to-use floor plan creation tools will enhance the services they offer to both homebuyers and sellers. It’s another step forward in ensuring our agents have access to industry-best resources.”\n\nCubiCasa’s MLS Partnership Program has now grown to more than 30 participating organizations since launching in December 2022. The program offers MLS members the opportunity to access complimentary floor plans, discounted optional features, and access to a directory of preferred real estate photographers who are utilizing CubiCasa’s cutting-edge technology.\n\n“The leadership at OneKey MLS is extremely forward-looking, and is yet another great partner to help in delivering a more digitized real estate market and better overall experience for both buyers and sellers,” said Jeff Allen, President of CubiCasa. “Digital floor plans provide a wide range of benefits to consumers, agents, lenders, and the entire real estate industry. We are thrilled that OneKey MLS has provided us with the opportunity to help them elevate the real estate experience in New York.”\n\nThe CubiCasa app is available for download from the App Store and Google Play Store.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey®

In addition to serving as SCBR’s Multiple Listing Service, OneKey MLS will be a strong supporter and premier sponsor for SCBR’s initiatives and events.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, OneKey MLS will continue to focus on the synergies that have existed between the two organizations. Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, said, “We are truly honored to support SCBR’s mission to advocate on behalf of its members and to support the numerous learning opportunities and events that help their members succeed. With the recent launch of such products as the Core Logic® mobile application, MLS-Touch®, and the consumer collaboration tool, OneHome™, OneKey MLS is providing the cutting-edge tools to succeed in a challenging market.\n\nSullivan County is the northern-most part of the OneKey MLS’s footprint, adjacent to Ulster, Delaware, and Orange Counties. Nestled in the Catskill Mountains, Sullivan County lies just over an hour outside the New York City limits, but its popularity as a vacation destination makes it feel as though it is a restorative oasis. Its largely rural geography separates Sullivan County from its neighbors, where residents enjoy much more house for their money in the sprawling landscape, surrounded by myriad outdoor recreation opportunities. SCBR’s President Rosie DeCristofaro said, “OneKey MLS is our choice. It provides our members with access to the regional areas where they do their business. It’s where the buyers and sellers are.”\n\nOneKey MLS is committed to working with SCBR on their shared vision, advocating for real estate initiatives while providing accurate data, a wealth of expertise, and technological innovation to our shared membership. CEO Haggerty said, “We value any opportunity to make an impact at a local level and strengthen our relationships. The MLS has a responsibility to evolve and advance existing partnerships to newfound heights.”\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York.

Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"article:published_time":"2023-08-14T23:19Z","og:description":"OneKey® MLS renews its partnership with the Sullivan County Board of REALTORS® to provide more opportunities for members to grow their businesses.

The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. (HGAR) and OneKey® MLS hosted a virtual panel last week featuring experts who surveyed New York’s political landscape, looked at laws and regulations, and shared intel on what real estate professionals need to know to support the industry.\n\n“The New York State Association of Realtors does an incredible job of getting in front of the legislators, particularly in Albany with their Lobby Day,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS, the regional multiple listing service that covers nearly a dozen counties in the greater NYC area from Manhattan, to Suffolk, Westchester and Sullivan.\n\n“Also, our state and local organizations have done calls to action and connected our members to legislators representing them in their districts,” Haggerty said. “It’s very effective.”\n\nBe Your Best - The Importance of Politics, Policy & NY Real Estate - 10/12/2023 - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQrMuB27faAmNf7eqsAjDWg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.onekeymls.com%2F)\n\nHudson Gateway Association of Realtors\n\n670 subscribers\n\n[Be Your Best - The Importance of Politics, Policy & NY Real Estate - 10/12/2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxIDpWIMnNY)\n\nHudson Gateway Association of Realtors\n\nSearch\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Andrea Stewart-Cousins. It was really powerful to see 100 people filling up that room. We had an organized agenda on state and local issues, which made an impact with the legislators.”\n\nHaggerty hosted “The Importance of Politics and Policy in New York Real Estate,” a virtual forum featuring Heather Domi, founding chair of the New York Residential Agent Continuum (NYRAC) and associate real estate broker at Compass; Jonathan Greenspun, managing director of Mercury Public Affairs; and Mike Kelly, director of government affairs for the New York State Association of Realtors. The Oct. 12 event was moderated by Brian D. Tormey, NTP, president of TitleVest, a leading NYC-based provider of title insurance and related real estate services.\n\nThe panel agreed on the importance for real estate professionals to know their local lawmakers and the issues, and to advocate for policies beneficial to the industry.\n\n“A lot of agents in our city are passionate about politics in our industry,” said Domi, who founded NYRAC in 2018 as a group of civic-minded agents to advocate for the industry. “The reality is, most people don’t take action because they rely on somebody else, such as the real estate boards, to do it. When individual constituents start contacting their local lawmakers, in large numbers, they move the needle and people listen. It’s very impactful and allows us to have a voice in what is happening in our industry. Our voice matters.”\n\nGreenspun of Mercury, a public strategy firm, urged viewers to get more politically involved.\n\n“The politics of real estate changed drasticallycirca 2018, when the Republicans no longer controlled the state Senate,” said Greenspun. “For years, real estate prospered … but with the election of AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY 14) and some very far left-wing members of the state legislature, thatturned the politics in Albany on its head.\n\n“The message for everyone tuning in today, and to convey to your colleagues, is get involved. It matters. The survival of your industry is dependent upon it,” Greenspun said.\n\nThe panel pointed to laws and issues impacting the industry, including:\n\n- Class-action lawsuits against the National Association of Realtors and other entities over commissions;\n- Brooklyn Councilman Chi Ossé’s bill to require landlords who hire a broker to pay the broker’s fees, as opposed to the renter automatically being responsible;\n- Good Cause legislation, which seeks to limit how a landlord can evict a tenant; and\n- The expiration of 421-A, which offered a real estate tax exemption for new housing construction.\n\n“It is critical for you to get involved politically and make your voice heard,” said Kelly, of the New York State Association of Realtors. “A working practitioner or a Realtor brings a voice to the issues that I talk to lawmakers about all the time. They have the expertise to talk to their lawmakers about why they like a bill or why they have concerns about a piece of legislation. I represent the industry, I have a good knowledge of the issues but I’m not working with buyers and sellers, or renters and property owners.”\n\nKelly ticked off races to watch in New York for 2024, including the 18th congressional district, where Republican Alison Esposito is seeking to oust Democrat Pat Ryan. He also pointed to Republican-held House seats in New York’s 1st, 3rd, 4th, 17th, 19th and 22nd districts that the Democrats are hoping to flip in 2024.\n\n“As I look toward these 2024 elections, there’s an opportunity for us to weigh in,” Kelly said. “My ask, at least of our own members is, I’m not going to tell you who to vote for, but you need to vote. Lawmakers need to know that real estate votes – that’s really important.”\n\nThe webinar is part of the “Be Your Best” series created by HGAR and OneKey® MLS, to help Realtors and agents navigate a changing landscape.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/politics-and-policy-in-new-york-real-estate","twitter:title":"Politics and Policy in New York Real Estate","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/BeYourBest-101223+%281%29-1920w.jpg","og:type":"article","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/BeYourBest-101223+%281%29-1920w.jpg","twitter:description":"The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and OneKey® MLS hosted a virtual panel featuring experts who surveyed New York’s political landscape, looked at laws and regulations, and shared intel on what real estate professionals need to know to support the industry.","language":"en","og:title":"Politics and Policy in New York Real Estate","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/BeYourBest-101223+%281%29-1920w.jpg","viewport":["initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","width=device-width, initial-scale=1"],"article:published_time":"2023-10-19T22:40Z","ogDescription":"The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and OneKey® MLS hosted a virtual panel featuring experts who surveyed New York’s political landscape, looked at laws and regulations, and shared intel on what real estate professionals need to know to support the industry.","og:description":"The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and OneKey® MLS hosted a virtual panel featuring experts who surveyed New York’s political landscape, looked at laws and regulations, and shared intel on what real estate professionals need to know to support the industry.","ogTitle":"Politics and Policy in New York Real Estate","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/politics-and-policy-in-new-york-real-estate","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","title":"\n    \n    Politics and Policy in New York Real Estate\n  \n  ","description":"The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and OneKey® MLS hosted a virtual panel featuring experts who surveyed New York’s political landscape, looked at laws and regulations, and shared intel on what real estate professionals need to know to support the industry.","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","scrapeId":"07339653-4adf-4a3a-82fd-36f74e0a5f57","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/politics-and-policy-in-new-york-real-estate","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/politics-and-policy-in-new-york-real-estate","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","Politics","Policy","New York","Industry","Advocacy"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2023-10-19","title":"Politics and Policy in New York Real Estate","description":"Experts Share Strategies for Engaging Local Lawmakers, Advocating for Industry Priorities.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

The Matrix platform is modern and robust, where users can create professional listing presentations, gain powerful insights to help evaluate client activity and maximize business efforts, and connect with customers across multiple channels. It’s the next generation MLS.\n\nMatrix is accessible through the Clareity dashboard, which provides easy navigation to the full range of OneKey MLS tools via single sign-on technology. Matrix works seamlessly with many of the existing OneKey MLS products, including MLS-Touch, an innovative mobile solution that provides easy access to MLS data on-the-go. The integration automatically syncs saved contacts, saved searches, and Realist® data. Moreover, customer relationships are improved with the addition of OneHome, a fully integrated client collaboration portal that provides you with a detailed view of all client activities, so clients never fall through the cracks. CoreLogic has designed all of these products for interoperability, ensuring the exchange of information to increase efficiency and accuracy.\n\nThe new listing management experience will not only be more intuitive and streamlined, but will also provide a new feature that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze, identify, and tag features in listing photos. These image tags will propose a label and description for each photo uploaded to a listing.\n\nOneKey MLS’s Board of Managers Chairperson Frank DellAccio remarked that Long Island agents have needed an MLS system upgrade for several years. “Change is unavoidable, but with change comes opportunity. As our business needs change, our MLS system must technologically evolve to keep pace and better serve our subscribers so they can meet their customers’ expectations. As the #1 MLS platform in North America, the Matrix platform gets us there.”\n\nOneKey MLS leadership is committed to making this process as transparent as possible. The first phase of the transition focuses on data accuracy, including data fields, lookup, and type to ensure consistency and precision. Then, in the following months, virtual and in-person trainings will be conducted on how to use Matrix so subscribers will be sufficiently prepared. As always, we are here to support you in any way we can and we will keep you apprised at every step throughout the process, so you are fully informed.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like.

Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","description":"The OneKey® MLS Board of Managers is excited to announce that in the fourth quarter of 2024, all OneKey MLS Participants and Subscribers will be transitioning to CoreLogic®’s MLS Platform, Matrix.","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Matrix-Listing-Detail-1920w.jpg","title":"\n    \n    Exciting News from OneKey MLS!\n  \n  ","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","ogTitle":"Exciting News from OneKey MLS!","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/exciting-news-from-onekey-mls","language":"en","twitter:description":"The OneKey® MLS Board of Managers is excited to announce that in the fourth quarter of 2024, all OneKey MLS Participants and Subscribers will be transitioning to CoreLogic®’s MLS Platform, Matrix.","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Matrix-Listing-Detail-1920w.jpg","article:published_time":"2023-12-20T22:28Z","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Matrix-Listing-Detail-1920w.jpg","twitter:title":"Exciting News from OneKey MLS!","ogDescription":"The OneKey® MLS Board of Managers is excited to announce that in the fourth quarter of 2024, all OneKey MLS Participants and Subscribers will be transitioning to CoreLogic®’s MLS Platform, Matrix.","og:title":"Exciting News from OneKey MLS!","og:description":"The OneKey® MLS Board of Managers is excited to announce that in the fourth quarter of 2024, all OneKey MLS Participants and Subscribers will be transitioning to CoreLogic®’s MLS Platform, Matrix.","og:type":"article","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/exciting-news-from-onekey-mls","scrapeId":"5459ed30-a04d-49ab-8453-a9cb38434e7a","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/exciting-news-from-onekey-mls","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/exciting-news-from-onekey-mls","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","OneKey MLS","Housing Market","Technology","Support"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025","title":"OneKey MLS","description":"OneKey MLS is the largest multiple listing service in New York, providing a range of solutions for real estate professionals, including branding, marketing, client collaboration, and more.

An experienced professional with more than a decade in collaborative real estate technologies, King was most recently Vice President of Strategic Alliances & Partnerships at a large neighboring multiple listing service: Bright MLS. In addition to overseeing the day-to-day operations of OneKey, King will also be a part of the Executive team that will oversee the implementation of the strategic plan, adopted by the Board of Managers earlier this year.\n\n“We’re delighted to welcome Melissa to our team at a time when OneKey® MLS, the largest multiple listing service in New York, is poised for growth,” said Richard Haggerty, incoming CEO as of Jan. 1, 2023. “She is an expert collaborator, and the breadth of her industry knowledge will be invaluable as we strive to support the success of our subscribers with more coverage and data.”\n\nPrior to her role at Bright MLS, where she led engagements on solutions initiatives, King was Director of Industry Relations for Compass, the largest independent real estate brokerage in the U.S. King began her career in the industry at Stellar MLS, the third largest multiple listing service in the U.S., in a series of management and executive roles within product, data, technology, and compliance over 10 years. Her industry involvement also includes serving as a member of multiple boards and committees, including the Council of Multiple Listing Services (CMLS), the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), and the Real Estate Standards Organization (RESO).\n\n“I’m thrilled to have this opportunity to be a part of OneKey® MLS’s exciting growth stage,” said King. “With this comprehensive, regional multiple listing service at brokers’ fingertips, the future is bright for one of the industry’s most desirable markets in the country.”\n\n﻿\n\nOneKey® MLS was born from a merger between the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island and the Hudson Gateway MLS in 2020, with a vision that goes beyond reliable property listings and provides REALTORS® with the tools to reach their highest professional goals.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:title":"OneKey® MLS Appoints Melissa King as COO","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/DSC_6366-826b56cd-1920w.jpg","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/DSC_6366-826b56cd-1920w.jpg","ogDescription":"Melissa King has been appointed as the new Chief Operations Officer for OneKey® MLS.

That leads to more qualified buyers who aren’t just browsing. They’re ready to buy.\n\n#### Engage every client on every listing\n\nThe Client Full RatePlug report in Matrix™ enables clients to interact with possible mortgage scenarios within the listing itself. They can manipulate their down payment, explore different loan programs, adjust interest rates, and even go directly to your lender for a quote. Clients can understand what the actual affordability of the property is — and that means more engagement for you.\n\n#### Real numbers for real properties\n\nWhen you connect RatePlug to your listings and your lenders, the exact cost of ownership is revealed, right down to the penny. It includes principal, interest, taxes and HOA, calculated in real time based on the information available within the MLS.\n\n#### Easy, automatic, and branded\n\nAdd your photo to the RatePlug system, and let RatePlug handle the rest. Choose from multiple flyer formats. Each flyer includes lenders’ rates and products, your listing’s property details, and your contact information. The system will even generate a social media post for you with affordability details.\n\n#### Made for social\n\nConnect your social accounts to RatePlug to instantly share your listings with affordability details for Facebook or X. Posts with affordability details get more engagement than those that do not contain any information about those costs.\n\n#### Enroll today\n\nThere is no special software to learn and it's easy to help your buyers take the next steps towards homeownership.

I know from personal experience.\n\n### If you’ve ever felt like you’re one misstep away from being “found out,” like you’ve somehow stumbled into your success and don’t truly deserve it, I want you to know—I see you.\n\nI know what it’s like to sit in a meeting, heart racing, afraid to speak up in case you reveal what you believe is your lack of knowledge. I know the weight of over-preparing, of brushing off compliments, of attributing every accomplishment to luck rather than skill. Imposter syndrome is a quiet, insidious companion, but I’ve come to realize something: It doesn’t mean we’re frauds. It means we care. And that, my friend, is a strength, not a weakness.\n\n#### Know When to Trust Your Instincts\n\nStarting my career in an entry-level position, I never imagined the path that would lead me to an executive role. In the early years, I faced countless challenges and tough decisions that tested my resilience.\n\n![Melissa King, COO, OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/DSC_6366-04b4ebbe-85be55f7-cd454b76-13ebd314-1920w.jpg)\n\nOne of the most profound struggles I encountered was wrestling with coaching that reinforced imposter syndrome, it advised me to speak with less confidence because my self-assurance made others uncomfortable. I internalized this guidance, making myself smaller in rooms where I should have stood tall. As a result, I developed a habit of qualifying my opinions with self-doubt, constantly softening my statements to avoid making waves. I began starting my sentences with “I’m not sure, but I think…” and “Maybe this isn’t relevant, but…”. Over time, I realized that this approach was holding me back, preventing me from fully stepping into my potential. It took years of deliberate work and coaching from friends within the industry—mentors who believed in my voice even when I had lost faith in it myself—to unlearn this tendency.\n\nImposter syndrome doesn’t just whisper doubts in our ears—it can be paralyzing. The consequences go beyond self-doubt. Studies show that imposter syndrome disproportionately affects high-achievers, particularly women and people from marginalized backgrounds. It can lead to burnout, stress, and missed opportunities, as we hesitate to take risks or advocate for ourselves. But here’s the thing: The very presence of imposter syndrome might mean you’re more competent than you think.\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect — the paradox that those who know little tend to overestimate their competence, while those who know more are often wracked with doubt—offers the possibility that you know enough and are competent enough to recognize what you don’t know.\n\n#### Balance Confidence with Self-Awareness\n\nI’ve started to see self-doubt not as proof of inadequacy but as evidence of self-awareness. The leaders who never question themselves are the ones who should concern us. We’ve all encountered them—the ones who assume they have all the answers, charging ahead without pausing to reflect or seek expertise when on untrodden ground. That kind of unchecked confidence can be dangerous as it can lead to stagnation. But self-doubt, when used wisely, fosters growth, humility, and intellectual curiosity. The best leaders aren’t those who never question themselves but those who balance confidence with self-awareness—knowing when to trust their instincts and when to look for more information or counsel.\n\nFor years, I equated success with certainty. Now, I’m beginning to realize that true success lies in the ability to question, recalibrate, and evolve. My unconventional career path has taught me that adaptability, resilience, and emotional intelligence matter far more than a flawless résumé.\n\nSo, what if feeling like you don’t belong at the table is proof that you care? That you’re thinking critically? That you’re pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone?\n\nToday, as an executive, I strive to create an environment where others don’t feel pressured to diminish themselves to fit in. I share my journey openly, hoping it serves as a reminder that growth is not just about professional milestones but also about rediscovering and embracing the strength within ourselves.\n\n#### You Belong Here\n\nI won’t pretend I’ve completely silenced the voice that tells me I’m not good enough. But I’m learning to respond differently. Instead of letting it hold me back, I’m using it as fuel—to keep showing up, keep learning, and keep proving to myself that I do, in fact, belong. And maybe, just maybe, that’s what real confidence looks like.\n\nSo, if you’ve ever felt like you’re one misstep away from being “found out,” like you’ve somehow stumbled into your success and don’t truly deserve it, you are not alone, and you are more capable than you know. Keep going. You belong here.\n\nWith solidarity,\n\nMelissa King\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Impostor-Syndrome-1920w.jpg","title":"\n    \n    How to Reframe Imposter Syndrome\n  \n  ","twitter:title":"How to Reframe Imposter Syndrome","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/essential-advice-on-reframing-imposter-syndrome-v2","og:title":"How to Reframe Imposter Syndrome","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Impostor-Syndrome-1920w.jpg","language":"en","ogTitle":"How to Reframe Imposter Syndrome","og:type":"article","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Impostor-Syndrome-1920w.jpg","description":"OneKey® MLS is the 10th largest MLS in the United States.

The acquisition brings OneKey MLS’s subscriber base to nearly 50,000 real estate professionals in more than 4,800 participating offices, serving Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley.\n\nAgents and brokers of Poughkeepsie-based Mid-Hudson MLS, which was formed in 1984, will now have access to a broader pool of comprehensive listing data. In addition, the consolidation will save subscribers time and money by simplifying access to data, removing duplicate MLS memberships and fees, and eliminating the need to enter and maintain listings in multiple systems.\n\nCEO of OneKey MLS Richard Haggerty remarked on the opportunity being presented to agents and consumers alike: “I have tremendous respect for the leadership of Mid-Hudson MLS and all they have achieved over the years. This consolidation makes perfect sense because it expands the reach of listing data to a contiguous geography and benefits our members and consumers who will now have access to a greater pool of information. It should result in time savings for our members as well as consumers.”\n\n“With our operating system due for an upgrade and the challenges facing our industry across the country, the timing of this acquisition works well for us,” said Brian Engles, Executive Officer of Mid-Hudson MLS. “OneKey MLS has a strong agent-centric business model and exemplary operating platform where our brokers and agents alike will benefit from access to the vast and comprehensive listing data offered by OneKey MLS, as well as the many tools which will now be available, including the exposure of their listings on the consumer facing website, OneKeyMLS.com.”\n\nThe consolidation is expected to be finalized in January 2024.\n\nOneKey MLS’s Board of Managers Chairperson Frank DellAccio said the transaction is a logical step for OneKey MLS as it continues to expand its coverage area to provide innovative solutions for real estate professionals and consumers.\n\n“This consolidation is a win-win all around,” said DellAccio. “It is our vision to continuously provide broader and better access to accurate data for our agents, brokers and consumers, for the betterment of the entire industry.”\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:description":"OneKey® MLS has acquired Mid-Hudson MLS, a privately, broker-owned multiple listing service with more than 1,400 agents and approximately 350 offices throughout Dutchess County and the Mid-Hudson Valley area.

The new policy is designed to give consumers clearer freedom in marketing their homes while ensuring fairness to buyers.\n\nThis new policy offers more choices for sellers and their agents in marketing a property. Multiple Listing Options for Sellers includes two exempt listing options:\n\n- **Office Exclusives (designated with the Private Y/N field in OneKey MLS)**\n\nThis is an exempt listing where the seller has directed that their property not be disseminated through the MLS and not be publicly marketed. The office exclusive listing is entered in OneKey MLS but is visible only to the listing brokerage. It does not disseminate to other sites, or other OneKey MLS Participants or Subscribers.\n\n- **NEW** **Delayed Marketing**\n\nThis is an exempt listing where the seller directs the listing broker to delay the public marketing of that listing through IDX and syndication for a period (\\*time period to be determined by OneKey MLS Board of Managers) while making the listing visible to other real estate professionals within OneKey MLS. During the delayed marketing period the home seller and the listing agent can market the listing in a manner consistent with the seller's needs and interests.\n\nBroker-to-broker, one-to-one communication may occur freely about office exclusive listings or delayed marketing exempt listings without triggering Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP) requirements to make the listing public and Active within one (1) business day. Both exempt listing options require informed consent from the seller certified in writing including:\n\n- disclosure about the professional relationship between Participant and seller\n- acknowledgement that the seller understands the MLS benefits they are waiving or delaying\n- confirmation of the seller's decision\n\nPlease note that this new policy will be implemented by September 30, 2025, or sooner.\n\n### Resources\n\n### Resources\n\n- [NAR Multiple Listing Options for Sellers FAQs\\\\\n\\\\\nNAR offer resources and answers on this new policy.\\\\\n\\\\\nItem Link](http://facts.realtor/)\n- [OneKey MLS Rules & Policies\\\\\nSection 302.2 addresses Clear Cooperation Policy\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn MoreList Item 1](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/29238087786260-OneKey-MLS-Rules-and-Procedures)\n- [NAR MLS Clear Cooperation Policy\\\\\nNAR offers explanation and frequently asked questions regarding Clear Cooperation.\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn MoreList Item 2](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/policies/mls-clear-cooperation-policy)\n- [OneKey MLS Frequently Asked Questions\\\\\n\\\\\nQuestions and answers regarding from OneKey MLS Participants and Subscribers regarding CCP and new policy options.\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn More](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/35871094849812-Clear-Cooperation-CCP-and-Multiple-Listing-Options-for-Sellers-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQs)\n\n### Communications\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Multiple Listing Options for Sellers Announcement 3/27/25\\\\\n\\\\\nOneKey MLS Announcement of Multiple Listing Options for Sellers and new _delayed marketing exempt listing status._\\\\\n\\\\\nItem Link](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/36067011227540-NAR-Announces-Multiple-Listing-Options-for-Sellers-Policy-3-27-25)\n- [From the Desk of the CEO 2/27/25\\\\\nOneKey MLS CEO, Richard Haggerty, offers a reminder regarding Clear Cooperation in his missive to OneKey MLS Participants.\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn MoreList Item 1](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/35177831768596-2-27-25-From-the-Desk-of-the-CEO-Ensuring-Fair-Housing-and-Equitable-Access-with-Compliance-to-Clear-Cooperation)\n\n# 2024 National Association of REALTORS® Settlement\n\n## Resources\n\n### List of Services\n\n- [NAR Settlement Impact: Your OneKey® MLS Rules and Procedures Questions Answered (On-Demand Class)\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this sixty minute webinar, OneKey® MLS executive leadership, CEO Richard Haggerty and COO Melissa King share the background of the settlement, the nitty gritty impact to your day-to-day practices using the MLS, answer frequently asked questions, and share resources available to help you pivot forward as real estate professionals serving your clients and the consumer for a common good, that of creating equitable access to information and opportunity for the purpose of helping individuals on the path home.\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn MoreList Item 1](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/29521367048084-NAR-Settlement-Impact-Your-OneKey-MLS-Rules-and-Procedures-Questions-Answered-On-Demand-Class)\n- [NAR Settlement: Compensation Fields to be Removed from the MLS\\\\\n\\\\\nIn alignment with the NAR Settlement's mandate to eliminate and prohibit MLS participants, subscribers and sellers from making any offers of compensation in the MLS to buyer brokers or other buyer representatives and the requirement that MLSs eliminate all broker compensation fields and compensation information in the MLS and  MLS-Touch.\\\\\n\\\\\nView FieldsList Item 2](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/28842130579988-NAR-Settlement-Compensation-Fields-to-be-Removed-from-the-MLS)\n- [Pre-Sale Concession Field Definitions\\\\\n\\\\\nIn alignment with the NAR Settlement, optional pre-sale concession fields are available to communicate a seller's willingness to negotiate concessions to a buyer. \\\\\n\\\\\nLearn MoreList Item 3](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/28723057112596-Pre-Sale-Concession-Field-Definitions)\n- [NAR Settlement: Forms Resources\\\\\n\\\\\nMany commonly used forms such as the Exclusive Right to Sell Listing Agreement are being amended in alignment with the NAR Settlement.

Linda’s passion for animal welfare runs deep. As the founder of the Animal Response and Rescue Coalition, she has made it her mission to protect and care for pets in need. Her journey as an advocate spans decades, and she has found loving homes for countless dogs and cats.\n\nAfter Superstorm Sandy in 2012, Linda’s commitment reached new heights. Seeing the devastation that left hundreds of pets displaced, she rallied REALTORS® to collect food, water, and even a washer and dryer to ensure these animals had clean blankets and a fresh start. She also volunteered at the shelter, walking dogs every day.\n\nLinda provides disaster training for first responders for displaced dogs and cats through her nonprofit. She has partnered with Proud Rescuers of Puerto Rico by fostering pups, caring for over 40 dogs and puppies while they await their forever homes.\n\nFor Linda, helping animals isn’t just a cause—it’s a calling. Like real estate, it’s about finding the perfect home and making a lasting impact.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:type":"article","og:description":"Linda Lugo, a OneKey MLS Board of Managers member, was honored at the NYSAR Business Meetings in February with a 2024 NYSAR Community Service Award.","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","description":"Linda Lugo, a OneKey MLS Board of Managers member, was honored at the NYSAR Business Meetings in February with a 2024 NYSAR Community Service Award.","article:published_time":"2025-02-10T18:19Z","ogDescription":"Linda Lugo, a OneKey MLS Board of Managers member, was honored at the NYSAR Business Meetings in February with a 2024 NYSAR Community Service Award.","language":"en","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/linda-682x1024-1920w.jpg","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","ogTitle":"OneKey MLS Board Member Linda Lugo Honored by NYSAR","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-member-linda-lugo-honored-by-nysar","twitter:title":"OneKey MLS Board Member Linda Lugo Honored by NYSAR","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/linda-682x1024-1920w.jpg","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-member-linda-lugo-honored-by-nysar","title":"\n    \n    OneKey MLS Board Member Linda Lugo Honored by NYSAR\n  \n  ","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/linda-682x1024-1920w.jpg","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","twitter:description":"Linda Lugo, a OneKey MLS Board of Managers member, was honored at the NYSAR Business Meetings in February with a 2024 NYSAR Community Service Award.","og:title":"OneKey MLS Board Member Linda Lugo Honored by NYSAR","scrapeId":"f8edd133-30cd-4835-ae56-b34efa724a49","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-member-linda-lugo-honored-by-nysar","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-board-member-linda-lugo-honored-by-nysar","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","Housing","Community Service","Animal Welfare","Nonprofit","Homeownership","Fair Housing"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025","title":"OneKey MLS","description":"OneKey MLS is the largest multiple listing service in New York, providing a platform for real estate professionals to connect and share listings.

The median sales price for single-family homes climbed to $775,000, marking a 6.2% gain. Condominiums saw a 5.1% increase to a median of $515,000, while co-op prices rose 7.0% to reach a median of $300,000. Meanwhile, closed sales for all properties edged down 6.0% year-over-year to 3,972 transactions, with single-family home closings down 4.6% to 2,981, condo closings down 12.9% to 501, and co-op closings easing 6.7% to 490 units.\n\nInventory remained tight across the region, with the total number of homes for sale declining 5.0% compared to June 2024, leaving 15,582 active listings. The month’s supply of inventory dipped slightly to 3.9 months, underscoring the competitive environment for buyers. New listings posted a modest year-over-year decrease of 1.5%, totaling 6,439 for the month.\n\n“While buyer interest remains strong, the market continues to be defined by limited inventory and affordability pressures,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS. “As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect steady demand and gradual price growth to persist as supply continues to lag behind.”\n\nPending sales activity offered some positive momentum for future closings, with a notable 8.2% annual increase to 4,848 contracts signed in June. However, with fewer new listings coming to market, inventory constraints are likely to continue through the summer.\n\nOneKey® MLS serves more than 42,000 real estate professionals throughout the New York metropolitan area.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

In June, median sales prices continued their upward trend for all property types — which include single-family homes, condominiums, and co-ops — rising 6.1% year-over-year to $700,000. The median sales price for single-family homes climbed to $775,000, marking a 6.2% gain. Condominiums saw a 5.1% increase to a median of $515,000, while co-op prices rose 7.0% to reach a median of $300,000. Meanwhile, closed sales for all properties edged down 6.0% year-over-year to 3,972 transactions, with single-family home closings down 4.6% to 2,981, condo closings down 12.9% to 501, and co-op closings easing 6.7% to 490 units. Inventory remained tight across the region, with the total number of homes for sale declining 5.0% compared to June 2024, leaving 15,582 active listings. The month’s supply of inventory dipped slightly to 3.9 months, underscoring the competitive environment for buyers. New listings posted a modest year-over-year decrease of 1.5%, totaling 6,439 for the month. “While buyer interest remains strong, the market continues to be defined by limited inventory and affordability pressures,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS. “As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect steady demand and gradual price growth to persist as supply continues to lag behind.”","price":"N/A","category":"Real Estate","availability":"Available","author":"Tricia Chirco","date":"July 15, 2025","name":"OneKey®

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-appoints-three-staff-members-recognizes-achievements-of-team-leaders","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","title":"\n    \n    OneKey® MLS Appoints Three Staff Members, Recognizes Team Leaders\n  \n  ","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","description":"OneKey® MLS is pleased to announce several staff appointments and industry achievements.

Listing agents can manage appointment availability, and enable their clients to review feedback from prospective buyers. All OneKey® MLS agents can save time and message each other through the app.\n\n#### Involve your clients\n\nAgents can also set their clients up with a mobile app, Home by ShowingTime™. Clients can manage showings, appointments, and tours. They can even monitor feedback from prospective buyers (and all buyer/agent information is always anonymized).\n\n#### Integrated with Matrix™\n\nShowingTime™ for the MLS is integrated with Matrix™. If the listing can be shown, the “Schedule a Showing” button is prominently displayed. Agents can schedule a single showing right from the listing, within the MLS itself, or via the mobile app.\n\n#### Simultaneous scheduling via ShowingCart®\n\nAgents can schedule multiple showings at once, and ShowingCart® will logically organize them with a map, driving directions, and drive times. Need to stop for lunch? Or include a listing that isn't in ShowingTime™? Insert a stop, or address and ShowingTime’s SmartRoute will automatically remap your route.\n\n#### Listing feedback\n\nCustomizable feedback can be requested from buyers after each showing, with up to 10 follow-ups to ensure prospects have every opportunity to provide it. Listing agents can share feedback with sellers in a report that enables clients to see for themselves how the market views their listing.\n\n### ShowingTime™ Mobile Application\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n\n### ShowingTime™ Scheduling on a Listing\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n\n### ShowingTime™ Home Page\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n\n### ShowingTime™ Report\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n\n### ShowingTime ™Calendar\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n\n### ShowingTime™ Listing Setup\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/showingtime)\n\n#### Popular Features\n\n##### Intelligent\n\n- Enables sellers and/or agents to manage requests via mobile app\n- Blocks out unavailable times to avoid surprises\n- Turn-by-turn driving directions for buyer tours\n\n\n##### Organized\n\n- Book multiple showings in a single session\n- Drag and drop reorganization\n- In-depth reporting\n\n\n##### Easy\n\n- Email, text, or print showing schedules\n- Automatic feedback requests\n- All OneKey® MLS agents already in the app\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [SentriLock®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/sentrilock)\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [OneHome™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/onehome)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [ShowingTime™ for the MLS Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27252859408020-ShowingTime-for-the-MLS-Resources)\n- [Explore Product Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

Set realistic goals, forecast future business trends, and plan strategically for growth.\n\n#### Track key performance metrics\n\nIdentify your top performers and those who might need additional support by tracking key performance metrics in Matrix™, such as the number of listings, pending, and closed transactions, sales volume, and commissions. Generate custom reports to analyze performance by different criteria, such as time periods, property types, or geographic areas. Gain insights into your office’s overall performance to make data-driven decisions to optimize your operations.\n\n#### Ensure agents follow the rules\n\nMaintain your office's reputation and leverage Listing Data Checker to make sure listings are accurate and complete. Track necessary documentation for transactions, as well actions taken by agents, including listing changes, status updates, and document submissions, to reduce the risk of fines or penalties.\n\n#### Help agents be more effective\n\nGet the visibility you need into all transactions and activities happening within your office so you can step in when necessary to support agents, resolve issues, or ensure that deals are progressing smoothly. You can also facilitate collaboration between agents within the office, create team structures, assign tasks, and share resources like templates and marketing materials so your agents work together more effectively on transactions.\n\n#### Integrate your transaction management system\n\nMatrix™ seamlessly integrates with TransactionDesk®, so you can oversee every transaction in your office from listing to closing so nothing falls through the cracks. You can automate repetitive tasks, like sending contract deadline reminders or follow-up emails. This reduces everyone's busywork, so you can spend your time on revenue-generating activities.\n\n### Matrix™ Dashboard\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/office-management)\n\n### TransactionDesk® Transactions\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/office-management)\n\n### TransactionDesk® Documents\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/office-management)\n\n#### Did You Know?\n\n##### Robust reporting and analytics\n\n- Custom reports on agent performance, market trends, productivity, and historical data inform strategic planning and resource allocation\n\n##### Seamless transaction management\n\n- Native integration ensures compliance and reduces liability during audits or legal reviews\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [TransactionDesk®](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/transaction-desk)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Explore Solution Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/categories/26660168719764-Office-Management)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

With OneKey® MLS, RESO-standard data is ready and waiting for you\n\n[Data Delivery Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27251536794644-Data-Delivery-Resources)\n\n## Comprehensive listing data, ready to integrate.\n\n#### Normalized RESO-standard data: MLS Grid for brokers\n\nWhether you, as a broker, need to send data to your company website, power your back office intranet, run analytics across your listing data or power other critical business software,[MLS Grid](https://mlsgrid.com/)will enable you to utilize a RESO-standard feed of OneKey® MLS listing data in a format that is easy to pull into your project. MLS Grid utilizes a Web API and the RESO Data Dictionary to streamline your access to data, with one set of business rules. That means that if you also subscribe to other MLSs who participate in MLS Grid, all of the feeds you work with will be governed by one set of business rules and will be in a common format. You can even deliver a data feed to your agents for their IDX websites via MLS Grid.  It's a tightly controlled data delivery system built for brokers.\n\n#### Application development: MLS Grid for technology vendors\n\nFor technology vendors in contract with a broker that belongs to OneKey® MLS, MLS Grid is the fastest onramp to ingest RESO-Standard data for your application. Once a vendor signs on with MLS Grid and requests a license to a broker's data, support, documentation, billing, and the keys to the feed itself is through a[sleek online portal](https://mlsgrid.com/).\n\n#### IDX websites: easy websites for agents\n\nAn Internet Data Exchange (IDX) website enables you to showcase your listings and as well as 98% of the properties for sale and rent on OneKey® MLS. IDX websites do not require a consumer to login to view property listings.\n\n#### Matrix™ property search: frameable data link for agents and brokers\n\nHave a website and need to drop in a property search element to help your web visitors find their next home? Use the Matrix™ Data Link (included with your subscription) to place a plug-and-play solution on your site. You can even limit the search radius to your service area to enable consumers to focus on you.\n\n#### VOW: Virtual Office Website for brokers\n\nA Virtual Office Website is available only to brokers and contains 100% of OneKey® MLS’s listing inventory. VOWs must have a password for consumers to login, and may contain data otherwise not available to the public. Brokers and agents cannot opt-out of syndication to VOWs.\n\n#### Back office feeds: custom data for brokers\n\nFor brokers who need access to every listing in the MLS to populate in-house applications, such as CRMs or agent-only intranets, OneKey® MLS can deliver a Broker Back Office data feed. Since these types of feeds contain non-public information, your application must be accessible exclusively via a login. You can also obtain a feed of your own listings, which has no restrictions on how it is used.\n\n### MLS Grid VOW RESO Standard Data\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/data-delivery)\n\n### MLS Grid Architecture and Business Processes\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/data-delivery)\n\n#### Popular Features\n\n##### Fresh listings\n\n- Updates every 15 minutes\n- Includes listings from the entire OneKey® MLS service area\n\n\n##### Wide selection of delivery methods\n\n- Dozens of approved vendors work with[MLS Grid](https://mlsgrid.com/)data\n- Easy integration\n\n\n##### Standardized data\n\n- RESO-standard fields\n- Common business rules\n- One data license\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix) ﻿\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [﻿MLS Grid Website](https://mlsgrid.com/)\n- [Data Delivery Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27251536794644-Data-Delivery-Resources)\n- [Explore Product Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

OneKey® MLS remembers and honors Leah Caro (1969-2025) for her tireless industry and consumer advocacy.\n\nBroker/Owner of Park Sterling since 2001, she served as President of Putnam-West Chester Association of REALTORs for two terms and President of the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service. She served for twelve years on HGAR's Legislative Council. She was the founding Chairperson of the OneKey MLS Board of Managers (BOM) and 2025 BOM member. She further co-chaired the West Chester Residential Opportunities Inc., and NAR's Housing Opportunities Council and Professional Standards Committee. She was certified as a real estate instructor. “Leah was at the epicenter of the early discussions that led to the formation of OneKey MLS and served as the first Chair of the Board of Managers after it launched. Her vision contributed greatly to the growth and success of OneKey MLS.” - Richard Haggerty, CEO\n\n### Innovator\n\n![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Luciane-1920w.png)\n\nWhen you meet **Luciane Serifovic**, you'll learn quickly that she's a go-getter. Where others may see problems, Luciane is looking for solutions, and that's just one of the reasons she was nominated as **Innovator**.\n\nLuciane is the CEO, founder, and broker of Luxian International Realty, a luxury boutique real estate business. An entrepreneur to boot, she offers investment and advisory services, has authored a book, and uses the proceeds to benefit children. Her most recent venture is creating Convierge, a real estate app which she describes as \"harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize how buyers and agents navigate one of life’s most meaningful decisions: finding a home.\"\n\n### Industry Ambassador\n\n![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Frank+Dellacio+%28640+x+640+px%29-1920w.png)\n\n**Frank DellAccio** is a dedicated professional and **Industry Ambassador** with a long history of service and volunteerism. Frank is the President and managing partner at Century 21 - AA Realty. A current OneKey MLS Board of Manager, and past president of the Board of Managers, Frank is an exemplar and mentor to newcomers and seasoned professionals in the real estate community. With experience as agent and broker, Frank excels at recognizing the needs, knowledge, and tools that the community requires to thrive. He shares his knowledge as NY continuing education instructor.\n\nFrank was nominated for this recognition by a OneKey MLS Staff person who had this to say, \"We would like to express sincere gratitude for Frank's participation and insightful feedback during testing of the new OneKey End User License Agreement (EULA) rollout. The time and effort dedicated to testing this feature helped OneKey identify areas for improvement to ensure a smoother user experience. The unique perspective and detailed observations are invaluable in delivering the best possible products to our customers.\" Frank has long offered advocacy and insights on behalf of the REALTOR community, identifying issues and opportunities for improvement.\n\n### The Agent Advocate\n\n![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Dennis+Wong-1920w.png)\n\n**Dennis Wong** knows advocacy, with a background in success and experience management, sales coaching, and real estate, it's no wonder he was nominated as **The Agent Advocate**. Dennis brings his talents to bear at Compass as Associate Sales Manager.\n\nThe OneKey MLS Staff person who nominated Dennis had this to say, \"We would like to express our heartfelt thanks for Dennis's exceptional advocacy concerning our Stratus to matrix conversion. Your willingness to champion this new system and share your positive and negative experiences has made a real difference.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

The average down payment assistance (DPA) buyers receive through these programs is $20,000, though some programs offer assistance of $100,000 or more with income limits up to $172,000.\n\n#### 79% of OneKey® MLS listings eligible for assistance\n\nNearly eight in 10 listings on OneKeyMLS.com are eligible for Down Payment Assistance, and every eligible listing automatically bears the DPR icon so it’s instantly recognizable. DPA can be used for single family homes, multi-family, and condominiums.\n\n#### Made for New York\n\nThe DPR program is market-adjusted for New York. The purchase price limit for a single family home is $806,000 in 2024. All your buyers have to do is live in the property as their primary residence. There are also programs for first-time buyers who want to invest in a multi-family property and live in one of the units while renting the others.\n\n#### Minimal buyer investment\n\nDPR programs do require a minimal investment from the buyer upfront of $500-$1,000 to purchase a property. But enabling first-time and repeat buyers to gain equity and pass down generational wealth is priceless.\n\n### Down Payment Resource Connect Website\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/down-payment-resource)\n\n### Listing on OneKeyMLS.com Eligible for DPR Assistance\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/down-payment-resource)\n\n### Down Payment Resource in Matrix™\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/down-payment-resource)\n\n#### Popular Features\n\n##### Wide variety of programs for multiple  types of buyers\n\n- First-time and repeat primary home buyers eligible\n- Income and purchase price limits are market-adjusted for New York\n- Can be combined with FHA and VA programs\n\n##### Down Payment Connect\n\n- Personal DPR link to send to buyers\n- Enables buyers to search for DPR programs\n- Engage, educate, and learn what type of home they want\n\n##### Works with 79% of OneKey® MLS listings\n\n- Single family homes\n- Multi-family\n- Condominiums\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Products\n\n- [OneKeyMLS.com](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/onekeymls)\n- [Matrix™](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/matrix)\n- [MLS-Touch](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/mls-touch) ®\n\n* * *\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Down Payment Resources Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/hc/en-us/articles/27704687009428-Down-Payment-Resource-DPR-Resources)\n- [Explore Product Support](https://support.onekeymls.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Support\n\nEmail:\n\nYour Message\n\nThank you for contacting OneKey® MLS.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/coming-soon-matrix-document-privacy-options","title":"\n    \n    Release Notes: March 12, 2025\n  \n  ","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Doc+Privacy-1920w.png","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/coming-soon-matrix-document-privacy-options","article:published_time":"2025-03-07T18:59Z","ogTitle":"Release Notes: March 12, 2025","language":"en","twitter:title":"Release Notes: March 12, 2025","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Doc+Privacy-1920w.png","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Doc+Privacy-1920w.png","description":"OneKey® MLS is the 10th largest MLS in the United States.

This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens.\n\nOne thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death.\n\nEvery April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR.\n\nFair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications.\n\nLet’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[LIBOR Fair Housing Events](https://www.lirealtor.com/brokers-agents/fair-housing) [HGAR Fair Housing Events](https://hgar.com/fair-housing)\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

Condominiums also saw an uptick, with a closed median sale price of $519,000, reflecting a significant increase of 11.6% from $465,000 the previous year. The closed median sale price for co-ops rose to $295,000, a 5.4% increase from $280,000 in August 2023.\n\nIn terms of transaction volumes, closed sales for single-family homes, condominiums, and co-ops were all down from last year. There were 3,889 single-family closed transactions in August 2024, a 6.5% decrease from August 2023. Condominium closed sales were 581 and co-op sales were 528, a 4.6% and 20.7% year-over-year decline respectively.\n\n#### Fewer But Higher-Value Transactions\n\n“The real estate market continues to show strength in pricing, with year-over-year increases across single-family homes, condos, and co-ops,\" said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS. \"However, the lower number of closed transactions in August reflects the ongoing inventory shortage and unpredictable interest rates, which are creating a more competitive and  selective market for sellers. This dynamic has led to fewer but higher-value transactions.”\n\nOneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from 12 counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein. For more detailed regional and county-based statistics about residential, condo, and co-op sales transactions, please visit[marketstats.onekeymls.com](http://marketstats.onekeymls.com/).\n\n#### About OneKey® MLS\n\nOneKey® MLS is one of the nation’s leading Multiple Listing Services, serving 45,000 real estate professionals and 4,300 participating offices throughout Long Island, New York City, and the Hudson Valley.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"language":"en","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKey-MLS-2024-Median-Sales-Price-1920w.png","twitter:title":"NY Regional Single-Family Home Price Jumps 8.4% in August 2024","article:published_time":"2024-09-16T22:23Z","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/new-york-regional-single-family-home-price-jumps-8-4-in-august-2024","title":"\n    \n    NY Regional Single-Family Home Price Jumps 8.4% in August 2024\n  \n  ","og:type":"article","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKey-MLS-2024-Median-Sales-Price-1920w.png","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","og:description":"OneKey® MLS reports that the regional single-family closed median sale price was $725,000 in August 2024, marking an 8.4% year-over-year increase from $669,000 in August 2023.

OneKey® MLS is the largest MLS in New York with over 45,000 real estate professionals serving Long Island, Manhattan, and the Hudson Valley.\n\n[MLS Grid](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/data-delivery)supports the real estate industry’s role of providing timely, accurate, and comprehensive data to subscribers and technology companies. With more than 500 MLSs nationwide, brokerages are often challenged to find ways to combine data from numerous markets to serve websites, marketing systems, market analytics, showing services, lockbox services and brokerage management systems. MLS Grid streamlines real estate data access, management, and compliance.\n\nThe Real Estate Standards Organization’s (RESO) Web API powers MLS Grid. The platform is built on trusted, open technology standards which help organizations efficiently deliver or receive data.\n\n“The dynamic New York market demands close attention to making data management as seamless as possible,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS. “MLS Grid provides a solution for our subscribers which will enhance market efficiency for all real estate transactions.”\n\nMLS Grid, run by MLS executives and developers, understands the industry and the challenges brokers, MLSs and associations face in an ever-evolving marketplace. It was built to deliver an easier way to provide standardized data.\n\n“We’re excited that OneKey® MLS sees the value we bring to making the market work better for all,” said MLS Grid CEO, Joseph Szurgyi. “MLS Grid is an essential part of any MLS’s mission to provide the best service to subscribers who are in an industry that demands high standards of service when it comes to managing data feeds and contracts.”\n\nMLS Grid is growing quickly and continues to support the adoption of RESO Web API throughout the industry. MLS Grid works with more than 1,455 data consumers and supports more than 70,000 data licenses nationwide.\n\nAbout MLS Grid\n\nCurrently representing nearly 360,000 MLS subscribers, MLS Grid was built by a nationwide network of multiple listing services to help real estate brokers, technology partners, and MLSs to provide easier access to standardized, streamlined data. The goal of MLS Grid is to offer a single point of access and management for RESO standardized data that is provided by MLSs and brokers. MLS Grid eliminates technology development and other redundancies through MLS collaboration while allowing MLSs to preserve their “localization” of standardized data. MLS Grid has successfully worked with data from connectMLS, Matrix, Paragon, Realtracs MLS, and Flexmls systems.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York.

With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","language":"en","ogTitle":"OneKey® MLS Selects MLS Grid as Solution to Data Feed Management","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","twitter:description":"OneKey® MLS joins a growing list of multiple listing services which rely on MLS Grid to manage data feed licensing and delivery.

Use custom reports and filters to formulate the best pricing and marketing strategy for your next listing.\n\n#### Start with the best data in the New York Metro: OneKey® MLS data\n\nWith more than a million listing and property records at your fingertips, OneKey® MLS's Matrix™ and Realist® access is the best place to begin your listing search, offering strategy, or research for your next listing in the Metropolitan New York area. Get access to meaningful listing and property-level views that layers listing, public records data, financial information, neighborhood trends, and demographic data. Create broad sweeping searches or drill down into custom options for the most discerning client.\n\n#### Understand everyone's motivations\n\nCheck out Realist® to review detailed tax records, including property tax amounts, assessment values, and history of ownership. This information can be cross-referenced with the listing data in Matrix™ to verify accuracy and provide a more comprehensive picture of the property's financial background. Realist® often includes mortgage history, which can offer insights into any property’s financial standing and potential equity, which is useful for pricing strategies or understanding seller motivations (especially when prospecting).\n\n#### Set the right price or pricing strategy\n\nWhile Matrix™ provides recent sales data, Realist® can offer a more extensive sales history, including previous sales prices and dates. This historical perspective helps in understanding property value trends and setting appropriate listing prices or offering strategies. Realist can identify if a property has been involved in foreclosures, short sales, or has other distressed property markers. This can be crucial for setting expectations with clients or identifying investment opportunities.\n\n#### Get to know the neighborhood\n\nRealist® includes detailed demographic data about the neighborhood, such as population density, income levels, and age distribution. This information can be used to target marketing efforts more effectively or to provide buyers with a better understanding of the community. Realist® provides data on nearby schools, including ratings and boundaries. This augments the location information found in Matrix™ with additional actionable details.\n\n#### Take it all in with a birds-eye view\n\nMatrix™ and Realist® offer detailed parcel maps and aerial views that can help visualize property boundaries and the surrounding area. This can be particularly useful for properties with large lots or irregular shapes, as it provides a clearer understanding of the land. You can add layers such as flood zones, zoning information, or environmental hazards to your maps in Realist®, offering buyers or sellers a more nuanced view of the property’s geographical context.\n\n#### Gather every comp\n\nWhile Matrix™ offers comparable sales for CMAs, Realist® allows you to delve deeper by including additional comps that may not be listed in Matrix™. This includes off-market sales or properties sold directly by owners, providing a fuller picture of the local market. Set custom filters for comparable properties, such as filtering by specific property characteristics or geographical boundaries, to ensure that your comps are as relevant as possible.\n\n#### Provide context and insight\n\nGenerate neighborhood reports that combine listing data from Matrix with market insights and trends from Realist that enable clients to envision both the property and its surroundings. Don't forget to include your reports on the ownership status of neighboring properties. Are they owner-occupied, absentee owners or owned by investors? Include other enhanced data, such as tax history, sales comps, and demographic information, so clients can understand your pricing and marketing strategy. Your presentation will be the best researched and most insightful analysis on the market they will receive.\n\n### Matrix™ Dashboard\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/searching-reporting)\n\n### Matrix™ Search Interface\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/searching-reporting)\n\n### Matrix™ Listing Detail\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/searching-reporting)\n\n### Realist® Dashboard\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/searching-reporting)\n\n### Realist® Property Comps\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/searching-reporting)\n\n### Realist® Neighborhood Profile\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/searching-reporting)\n\n### Realist® In-Depth Property Report\n\n[Button](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/solutions/searching-reporting)\n\nView more\n\n#### Did you know?\n\n##### More data, more insight\n\n- Cross-reference rich public records and tax data with the listing data in Matrix to provide a more comprehensive picture of listings\n\n##### Custom filters, layers\n\n- Filter data to reveal critical insights about the neighborhood, zoning, investors, owners, schools, land, hazards, or lot boundaries to create the most relevant reporting.

It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character.\n\n![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/DSC_6366-04b4ebbe-85be55f7-cd454b76-13ebd314-1920w.jpg)\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground.\n\nThe real estate industry has a [well-documented history](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-city-housing-discrimination/)\nof overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better.\n\nTransparency is crucial. The NAR's [Clear Cooperation Policy](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/updates)\nlimits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences.\n\nA [2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation](https://nationalfairhousing.org/resource/2020-fair-housing-trends-report/)\nrevealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market.\n\nMore recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A [2025 Zillow analysis](https://www.zillow.com/research/mls-pln-sale-price-34846/)\nrevealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally.\n\nThese statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure.\n\nOur commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry.\n\nFair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![house keys on a black background](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31424880-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\n### [Small Moments, Big Impact](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/small-moments-big-impact)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•April 2, 2025\n\nApril is the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Fair Housing month and a great time to reinforce how good habits and actions, big and small, keep us accountable and have a significant impact in championing fair and equitable access to housing for all.

Every listing connects consumers directly with the listing agent(s) and brokerage, so consumers are assured they won’t be communicating through a third-party agent or advertiser. Searches are available in 21 languages.\n\nThe objective of[OneKeyMLS.com](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/onekeymls)is to provide a lead-generating platform for subscribers that represents the one source marketplace for consumers. OneKeyMLS.com, which launched in 2020, has received over 13 million visitor sessions, generating over 4.5 million listing alert emails for consumers. “We are committed to serving the best interests of consumers, real estate professionals and our industry – and that has remained front and center throughout our site redesign,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey® MLS. “The site’s activity since going live indicates there is a great thirst for a public-facing MLS search portal, and now we’ve made it even better.”\n\nKeeping buyers and sellers connected to the market and helping them make informed decisions is a priority for OneKey MLS. The new site features text alerts to help consumers stay on top of the fast-moving market. Users who create a free account to save and follow listings and searches can sign up for text alerts and receive updates on a listing’s status, price changes, and upcoming open houses. Users also get alerts when new properties are added to the areas they’re tracking on OneKeyMLS.com.\n\nConsumer-friendly informational tools are also available on the site. Consumers can learn about mortgages and interest rates, and calculate which mortgage best suits their needs, in the comprehensive OneKeyMLS.com Mortgage Center. The site also displays which listings are eligible for some form of down payment assistance through Down Payment Resource, a national database which connects homebuyers with homebuying assistance programs. Additionally, the site hosts a real estate advice blog about homeownership, property and design trends, and helpful tips to understand the real estate market. Consumers can sign up for a weekly newsletter that features timely real estate news and information.\n\nCEO Haggerty is proudly looking forward to seeing how the initiative comes together. He said, “Operating a consumer-facing portal provides the MLS with the opportunity to manage the relationship between our subscribers and their customers. As the source of the listings, it’s our vision to provide a streamlined path to homeownership by operating a user-friendly marketplace that prioritizes accurate data and technological innovation.”\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"ogTitle":"New OneKeyMLS.com Re-Launches with Texting and More Data","twitter:title":"New OneKeyMLS.com Re-Launches with Texting and More Data","twitter:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKeyMLS-Listing-1920w.jpg","og:image":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKeyMLS-Listing-1920w.jpg","title":"\n    \n    New OneKeyMLS.com Re-Launches with Texting and More Data\n  \n  ","og:description":"OneKey® MLS has launched an enhanced version of OneKeyMLS.com, the consumer property search portal offering listings in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley region from 45,000 subscribers and 4,500 participating offices in the New York regional coverage area.","viewport":"initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, viewport-fit=cover","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","ogUrl":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-relaunches-onekeymls-com-the-comprehensive-consumer-property-search-portal-for-nyc-long-island-and-hudson-valley","og:title":"New OneKeyMLS.com Re-Launches with Texting and More Data","language":"en","ogDescription":"OneKey® MLS has launched an enhanced version of OneKeyMLS.com, the consumer property search portal offering listings in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley region from 45,000 subscribers and 4,500 participating offices in the New York regional coverage area.","twitter:description":"OneKey® MLS has launched an enhanced version of OneKeyMLS.com, the consumer property search portal offering listings in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley region from 45,000 subscribers and 4,500 participating offices in the New York regional coverage area.","article:published_time":"2023-09-13T23:00Z","ogImage":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/OneKeyMLS-Listing-1920w.jpg","favicon":"https://irp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/site_favicon_16_1722453343277.ico","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","og:type":"article","og:url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-relaunches-onekeymls-com-the-comprehensive-consumer-property-search-portal-for-nyc-long-island-and-hudson-valley","description":"OneKey® MLS has launched an enhanced version of OneKeyMLS.com, the consumer property search portal offering listings in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley region from 45,000 subscribers and 4,500 participating offices in the New York regional coverage area.","scrapeId":"677d1077-313c-4162-a2b7-ad4857624d80","sourceURL":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-relaunches-onekeymls-com-the-comprehensive-consumer-property-search-portal-for-nyc-long-island-and-hudson-valley","url":"https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-relaunches-onekeymls-com-the-comprehensive-consumer-property-search-portal-for-nyc-long-island-and-hudson-valley","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;charset=utf-8","proxyUsed":"basic","creditsUsed":5},"json":{"image_url":"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png","tags":["Real Estate","MLS","Property Search","Consumer Services"],"address":"400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5, Farmingdale, New York 11735; 300 Sunrise Highway, West Babylon, New York 11704; 1 Maple Ave, White Plains, New York 10605","id":"onekey-mls-2025","title":"OneKey® MLS Relaunches OneKeyMLS.com","description":"OneKey® MLS has launched an enhanced version of OneKeyMLS.com, the consumer property search portal offering listings in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley region from 45,000 subscribers and 4,500 participating offices in the New York regional coverage area.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\n[![Sunil Anthony](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/SunilAnthony-793f489b-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/sunil-anthony-welcomed)\n\n### [Sunil Anthony Welcomed as Director of Innovation](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/sunil-anthony-welcomed)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•March 21, 2025\n\nSunil Anthony's superpower is seeing innovation where others see obstacles—turning challenges into opportunities, aligning change with vision, and executing solutions that help drive innovation and success.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey®

Haggerty, who currently serves as CEO of the Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS® and as President and Chief Strategic Growth Officer of OneKey® MLS, will succeed Jim Speer, the current CEO, on Jan. 1, 2023. Speer has announced his plans for retirement at the end of this year.\n\n“After completing a comprehensive search process for Jim’s replacement, we were pleased to have determined Richard to be the best individual to assume the leadership of OneKey® MLS,” said Linda Lugo, chairperson of the Board of Managers. “From its inception, Richard’s unwavering commitment to the success of our organization and his understanding of the vital role the MLS plays in real estate, makes him uniquely qualified to lead OneKey® MLS through the next phase of our development that is centered around growth.”\n\nHaggerty, a highly regarded real estate leader, has a long list of accomplishments that have been well-earned over his 38 years working in the industry. At the top of this list is spearheading the merger and formation of the first metro area regional MLS. Haggerty said, “Approximately four years ago, we came together with the Long Island Board of REALTORS® to leverage the incredible geography of New York City and the greater suburban areas to create something that will benefit our members and also benefit our consumers. That vision is even more relevant today, as the pandemic has led to a more regionalized market with homebuyers searching over a much larger geography.”\n\nSpeer, who will retire at the end of this year, expressed his utmost confidence in the Board of Managers’ choice of Haggerty as his successor. “Richard is a remarkable leader who has been responsible for a big part of our organizations success over a short period of time.” Speer said. “I am confident that Richard will ensure that OneKey® MLS will continue to evolve under his direction.”\n\nLikewise, Haggerty wished Speer all the best on his impending retirement. “Jim was part of the vision of OneKey® MLS from the very beginning, and he did a tremendous job launching OneKey MLS during one of the most challenging times in our history, when COVID was overwhelming our region,” said Haggerty. “He is one of the most highly-respected MLS executives in the country and he leaves very big shoes to fill, to put it mildly. I look forward to leading OneKey® MLS in the next chapter of its growth.”\n\nThe Board of Managers of OneKey® MLS takes pride in what it has accomplished over a few short years under Jim’s leadership and looks forward to continued growth and success under Haggerty’s tenure as Chief Executive Officer.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"description":"The Board of Managers of OneKey® MLS named Richard Haggerty as the new Chief Executive Officer for OneKey® MLS.

These time-intensive positions are unpaid, and demand a level of expertise and commitment that only seasoned real estate professionals can contribute to steer the tenth largest MLS in the United States.\n\nThe OneKey® MLS Board of Managers also has three outside managers who contribute their expertise, leadership, perspective, and vision from industries outside of real estate, including technology, and media.\n\nThe combination of real estate expertise and broad spectrum business knowledge gives OneKey® MLS a particular edge in making long term strategic decisions with respect to technology, including emerging issues such as: artificial intelligence, copyright law, and large language models which will likely affect our industry.\n\nThe Board of Managers meets monthly with the executive staff of OneKey® MLS.\n\n![Mark Boyland ](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/mark-4-square-1920w.png)\n\n#### Mark Boyland\n\nChairperson\n\nKeller Williams Realty Partners\n\nBedford, NY\n\n![Moses Seuram](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/moses-seuram-headshot-2024-small-edited-1920w.png)\n\n#### Moses Seuram\n\n**Vice Chairperson**\n\nKeystone Realty\n\nJamaica, NY\n\n![Christopher Bacchus](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Bacchus-Chris-2024-edited-1920w.jpg)\n\n#### Christopher Bacchus\n\nDouglas Elliman Real Estate\n\nNew Hyde Park, New York\n\n![Anthony Domathoti](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/anthony-domathoti-d2a02f44-1920w.jpg)\n\n#### Anthony Domathoti\n\nEXIT Realty Premium\n\nBronx, NY\n\n![Linda Lugo](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/linda-edited-1920w.jpg)\n\n#### Linda Lugo\n\nRealty Masters North Shore\n\nHuntington, NY\n\n![Melissa Gomez](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Melissa-Gomez_cropped-394x450-1-edited-1920w.webp)\n\n#### Melissa Gomez\n\nERA/Top Service Realty\n\nQueens Village, NY\n\n![Pati Holmes](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/patiholmes-edited-036dfcfb-1920w.png)\n\n#### Pati Holmes\n\nJulia B.

We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need.\n\nImpactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society.\n\nWith the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter.\n\nAdditionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by [DPR](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/products/down-payment-resource)\n(a resource provided through OneKey MLS).\n\nNatasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities.\n\nIn 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.\n\nLearn more about Impactful Lives' mission and programs, and explore ways to

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers.

Now, all OneKey MLS subscribers will have access to RentSpree’s ApplyLink™ for new and existing rental listings, cutting down transaction time, limiting liability, increasing efficiency, and keeping the agent central to the rental transaction.\n\n“The integration launched less than two months after the partnership was announced, demonstrating outstanding levels of collaboration and teamwork from all parties involved,” OneKey® MLS CEO Richard Haggerty said. “RentSpree is the latest in a series of resources we’ve added that allow us to continue delivering on our focus to empower our subscribers to grow their businesses with the latest and greatest real estate technologies available on the market.”\n\nDemand for rentals in the New York regional marketplace continues to be strong, especially as interest rates make the homebuying journey more difficult for average buyers. Despite rental prices continuing to rise in New York, with fewer homes for sale, more prospective tenants are completing rental applications.\n\nThis was a driving factor in the decision to partner with RentSpree, CEO Haggerty said. “We believe this flagship rental tool can make a difference in our subscribers’ daily lives, make their workflow more efficient, and make it easier for them to aggregate all the pieces required for a successful rental transaction.”\n\nAdded RentSpree Co-Founder and CEO Michael Lucarelli, “Since we announced our partnership, our team has worked at record speed to ensure a smooth, successful integration. We are excited for OneKey® MLS subscribers to have access to our software, which will cut down the processing time from days to minutes on such important tasks as tenant screening as well as other valuable real estate tools.”\n\nOnce enabled, OneKey® MLS subscribers need only toggle RentSpree on for each of their rental listings and RentSpree will do the rest – walking prospective tenants through the application process, collecting application fees, screening tenants, and alerting subscribers when completed applications have been submitted.\n\n“RentSpree will allow our subscribers to drastically reduce the time they take with any individual rental transaction and easily manage the entire process with just a couple of clicks,” said CEO Haggerty.\n\n### [More News](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/about/news)\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-7942442-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\n### [OneKey Recognizes Key Real Estate Professionals](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-recognizes-key-real-estate-professionals)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•August 1, 2025\n\nAt OneKey MLS we appreciate our customers every day, but recently we asked staff to nominate customers for their standout efforts in the following categories:\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-31353860-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\n### [Summer Updates](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/summer-add-edit-search-and-report-updates)\n\nBy Valerie Stephan•July 22, 2025\n\nSummer 2025 Release Notes updated 8/25/25\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Report Highlights Shifts in Closed Sales Amid Ongoing Inventory Constraints in New York Regional Housing Market](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-report-highlights-shifts-in-closed-sales-amid-ongoing-inventory-constraints-in-new-york-regional-housing-market)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•July 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the largest MLS in New York, has released its latest regional housing market report, showing a slight dip in closed sales activity while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.\n\n[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-2949992-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\n### [National Homeownership Month Changemakers – Impactful Lives](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/national-homeownership-month-changemakers-impactful-lives)\n\nBy Richard Washington•June 30, 2025\n\nNational Homeownership Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that make homeownership an accessible option for everyone and to evolve the conversation about what a home looks like. We also want to highlight individuals and initiatives that are working towards helping those in need. Impactful Lives is a nonprofit organization supporting unhoused young mothers living in shelters. Founded by Natasha Williams, the organization adopts a holistic, community-driven approach to address five critical challenges faced by these mothers: reproductive justice, economic insecurity, youth development, educational attainment, and food insecurity. Through tailored support, mentorship, career guidance, and essential provisions, Impactful Lives empowers these women to transform their circumstances and emerge as thriving contributors to society. With the mantra \"The time to make a difference is now,\" Impactful Lives offers several programs focused on mental health support, provides essential supplies, and celebrates achievements. These programs include back-to-school and essential item drives, grocery store outings to help mothers purchase fresh produce, moving celebrations for those transitioning to independent living, and intimate sessions where successful mothers volunteer to share their personal journeys, offering hope and inspiration to moms currently in shelter. Additionally, their annual signature event: hosting uplifting Mother’s Day brunches at the shelters serves as a moment of refresh and inspiration. Lastly, Impactful Lives works with women to build a plan for homeownership that includes down payment assistance, aided by DPR (a resource provided through OneKey MLS). Natasha Williams, the driving force behind Impactful Lives, brings over 15 years of expertise in finance, a distinguished background as a youth educator, and a successful career in real estate. Her unwavering commitment to community empowerment and social change inspired her to create this self-funded nonprofit, where she serves as both founder and president with passion and dedication. She also regularly teaches first-time homebuying seminars to help buyers navigate the process and partners with housing agencies to expand access to down payment assistance, financial education, and sustainable homeownership opportunities. In 2023, Natasha Williams was honored with the REALTOR® Spirit Award from the Long Island Board of REALTORS® for her extraordinary impact and dedication to her community. Under her leadership, Impactful Lives continues to ignite hope and foster meaningful change for young mothers in need.

No Room for Discrimination](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/fair-housing-no-room-for-discrimination)\n\nBy Melissa King•April 18, 2025\n\nAs an MLS executive and someone who believes deeply in fair and equitable access to housing, I don't view fair housing as a compliance item — I see it as a fundamental responsibility. Either our systems support equity, or they leave room for bias. There isn't a middle ground. The real estate industry has a well-documented history of overt and subtle discrimination. As stewards of the MLS, we must do better. Transparency is crucial. The NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy limits pocket listings and private networks that restrict access. While off-MLS strategies may seem harmless, research indicates they can have negative consequences. A 2020 National Fair Housing Alliance investigation revealed that pocket listings harm buyers from historically marginalized communities by limiting their access to available homes. By marketing properties privately within small, homogeneous networks, this practice reinforces exclusivity and restricts opportunities for others, undermining the principle of an open and competitive market. More recent studies have provided compelling data on the detrimental effects of pocket listings and private networks in real estate. A 2025 Zillow analysis revealed that New York homes sold off the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) typically fetched $13,749 less than those listed on the MLS. The impact is even more pronounced in communities of color – almost 3% less than sellers in majority-white neighborhoods nationally. These statistics highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive listing practices. We promote fair access and help sellers achieve the best financial outcomes by ensuring that properties are listed on the MLS. This practice also guarantees that all buyers have an equal opportunity and that sellers benefit from wider market exposure. Our commitment goes beyond implementing policies. We must also do more by leveraging technology to identify discriminatory language, establish rules that prevent harmful practices, and provide education and guidance to our users. These actions form the foundation of our industry. Fair housing isn't a political issue. It's a matter of professional integrity—and, not least of all, of human character. At the MLS, we play a central role in shaping how real estate is practiced—and that includes ensuring the systems we maintain are fair, transparent, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n[![A model house is sitting on top of a graph next to a pen and calculator.](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Membio+News+Page+Market+Report+-1920w.jpg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\n### [OneKey® MLS Reports March 2025 Real Estate Trends: Continued Seller-Favored Market with Varied Regional Pricing Shifts](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/onekey-mls-reports-march-2025-real-estate-trends-continued-seller-favored-market-with-varied-regional-pricing-shifts)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 15, 2025\n\nOneKey® MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, has released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025, reflecting a continued competitive market that favors sellers.\n\n[![Keys hang in a lock in an open door](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-101808-1920w.jpeg)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\n### [Ocusell Partnership Announcement](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/ocusell-partnership-announcement)\n\nBy Tricia Chirco•April 14, 2025\n\nOcusell is proud to announce its latest partnership with OneKey MLS, the largest Multiple Listing Service in New York. Through this collaboration, Ocusell provides OneKey MLS subscribers with the ability to seamlessly create and manage listings and populate them directly into the Matrix MLS system. With over 45,000 subscribers serving Long Island, New York City, and Hudson Valley region, OneKey MLS supports one of the most diverse and dynamic housing markets in the country. To meet the demands of this uniquely broad inventory—from Manhattan co-ops to beachfront homes on Long Island—they needed a listing management solution flexible enough to handle a wide range of property types and business rules. Enter Ocusell List™. Designed for speed, accuracy, and adaptability, it streamlines the entire listing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and real-time validation checks, agents can reduce listing creation time by up to 82%, cut compliance violations by over 75%, and publish to multiple MLSs instantly—all from a single platform. “At OneKey® MLS, we’re committed to empowering our 45,000 real estate professionals with innovative tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and compliance,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Ocusell’s platform gives our agents and brokers their time back by streamlining the listing process and reducing compliance issues before a listing ever goes live. This partnership reflects our ongoing mission to deliver real value at every stage of the listing lifecycle—for both our members and our MLS staff.” Ocusell’s platform works with a broad spectrum of property types, ensuring that listings are created quickly, accurately, and in compliance with OneKey MLS rules. Real-time validation checks automatically alert agents to potential issues before a listing goes live, improving both the speed and accuracy of the listing process. “OneKey MLS is an exemplary forward-thinking MLS that recognizes the value of streamlining the listing process while maintaining compliance,” said Hayden Rieveschl, CEO and Co-founder of Ocusell. “This partnership marks an exciting next step in the evolution of MLS technology and data management.” OneKey MLS joins previously announced partnerships with FMLS in Georgia and HIVE MLS in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, bringing Ocusell’s user base to over 100,000 professionals in just a few months.\n\n[![Silhouette of a house on a blurred sunset landscape](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/fair+housing-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\n### [Building Bridges](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/building-bridges)\n\nBy Richard Haggerty•April 11, 2025\n\nFive years ago, in late March 2020, OneKey MLS, LLC was launched. This was almost at the very same time COVID started running rampant in New York, and the real estate industry was, in essence, shut down. Those were scary times. I live on the Upper East Side in New York, and for weeks, all you would hear was the sound of sirens. One thing that struck me at the time was the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on those individuals without homes or living in unsafe housing conditions, and often, these individuals were members of minority communities. It truly brought home in a very personal way the importance of access to housing. It truly can become a matter of life or death. Every April, we celebrate Fair Housing Month, and it can be easy to do the same sound bites and repeat the same talking points. I challenge you to go beyond those talking points. Find out how you can make a difference in the communities you serve. There are volunteer opportunities and advocacy efforts in every geography that OneKey MLS serves, primarily through our shareholder associations, LIBOR and HGAR. Fair housing and inclusive access to housing should be our collective focus 365 days a year, not just during April. Real estate professionals should not be considered the gatekeepers to housing opportunities--we need to be the bridge to housing opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about private listing networks and more limited approaches to marketing properties. Exposing property listings to the widest possible audience is a win-win for buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants alike, with few exceptions. I respect consumer choice; however, limiting access to listed property can create potential fair housing implications. Let’s continue exploring how we can broaden access to homeownership and unlock the generational wealth that can accompany it. Let’s focus on building bridges to housing access rather than being the gatekeepers. Let’s make a difference in our communities.\n\nShow More\n\n[![OneKey® MLS](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/78412f62/dms3rep/multi/opt/Logo_White-gold-key_Gold-Key-1920w.png)](https://corporate.onekeymls.com/)\n\n[facebook](https://facebook.com/onekeymls)[twitter](https://x.com/onekeymls)[instagram](http://instagram.com/onekeymls)[linkedin](http://linkedin.com/company/onekeymls)[youtube](https://m.youtube.com/onekeymls)\n\n* * *\n\n##### Farmingdale\n\n400 Broadhollow Road, Suite 5\n\nFarmingdale, New York 11735\n\n##### West Babylon\n\n300 Sunrise Highway\n\nWest Babylon, New York 11704\n\n##### White Plains\n\n1 Maple Ave\n\nWhite Plains, New York 10605\n\n* * *\n\n© 2025\nOneKey® MLS, LLC\n\n[Equal Housing Opportunity](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp)\n\n[Powered by Membio](https://membio.com/)\n\nShare by:","metadata":{"og:title":"OneKey® MLS Launches RentSpree Integration for All Subscribers","ogDescription":"OneKey® MLS's new integration with RentSpree’s platform will streamline rental transactions.
